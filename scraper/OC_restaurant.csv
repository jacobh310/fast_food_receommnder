Pt123123,50.0,"In N Out Double Double Hamburgers with grilled onions (you need to ask for grilled onions otherwise you get raw onions) is the best hamburger, just like in the good old days (1950s and 1960s). If you prefer no cheese, ask for a Double Double...No Cheese with grilled onions. This saves calories. Their thin french fries are very addicting also, but they pair well with the Double Double. Adding a shake is another treat and more calories, but you only live once so it's a treat to eat at In N Out once a month or more.More",September 2020,In N Out Burger

shanellesua,50.0,"Pastrami-centric joint serving up some great pastrami fries. They‚Äôre currently operating during coronavirus both through drive through and for takeout. I would suggest calling ahead to place your order as the drive through line was long. They had our food ready in ~15 min. There...was a minor issue when we called in the order; the first time, the person on the other side didn‚Äôt hear us and the second time the call didn‚Äôt go through. Third times a charm though, so luckily we were able to indulge. 

This isn‚Äôt on the menu, but if you want to have a lunch that serves 3-4 people, you can order the wet fries (the gravy it comes with is so creamy and heavy) with pastrami and cheese on top (extra for both items). The pastrami is thinly sliced and they do not skimp. They did a good job of mixing the things so that even the fries on the bottom had a mix of gravy and pastrami in there. The fries are standard cut and we‚Äôre piping hot. We went into a minor food coma afterwards 

It‚Äôs super clean inside. They do take credit cards. Service is quick and efficient. Overall it‚Äôs a good spot to partake in pastrami and treat yourself should you ever find yourself around the Brea Mall.More",June 2020,The Hat
MO_Rates_Em,40.0,"We just made our first trip to The Hat after hearing about it for years from others.  And we will definitely be going back, even though it's a 20-30 minute drive for us.

Very first thing: Be Forewarned!  This place gets BUSY.  And go HUNGRY....We went during lunch time on a Thursday.  We got there literally 3 minutes before a big rush.  We ordered at the counter, and then grabbed one of several open booths.  No more than 2 minutes later the ordering line was out the door and all the tables and booths were full.

This The Hat is located on the side of a shopping center (facing St. College Blvd), and is in a stand-alone building.  There seemed to be enough parking.  They do have a drive through, but we opted to eat there.  The dining area is fast-food casual, and not terribly large.  Maybe 20 tables and booths total.

Menu is pretty basic (sandwiches, burgers, dogs), but they do have the Pastrami sandwich that is their specialty and claim to fame.  We ordered and shared a pastrami sandwich, a roast beef sandwich with au jus, a wet fries (gravy on them fries), and onion rings.  It was WAY too much food for two people, but we wanted to try a few things and bring the rest home.  First the sandwiches:  Pastrami was awesome!  Tender, not fatty or greasy, not too salty.  Perfect.  The roast beef was just average, and the au jus had no flavor.  I would not recommend the roast beef, unless you opt for the gravy instead of the au jus.  The sizes of the sandwiches were also average, not huge.  What was huge were the side orders.  The wet fries could easily feed 2-3 normal people.  Fries were standard burger stand fries, but the gravy was delicious and generously poured over the fries.  Onion rings were also very good, some of the better rings I've ever had at a place like this.  We only noticed later that they have pastrami-chili-cheese fries...my mouth is already watering as I write this and I know what I'm ordering next trip!

Prices are a bit expensive for a fast food joint.  We dropped $40 for two sandwiches, two sides, and two drinks.  Granted, we did order enough food for 4 people.

Over all good place, and a must-try if you like pastrami.More",January 2020,The Hat

The views are beautiful and you will need the walk after eating all that food.More",February 2020,Crystal Cove Shake Shack

When I arrived I was greeted by a advertisement saying to try the new BFC Angus Thickburger. I thought to myself maybye I should...give it a try. There was no picture of the burger attached so I had no idea what I was getting myself into. As I entered the drive through I ordered my Thickburger and a side of fries and a soda. When I paid and the bag of food was given to me I parked in the parking lot and preceded to open up the bag. I took out my fries and the soda and I looked into the bag I see my burger wrapped. I observed it before I took it out and then took the foiling off around it. I was greeted by a giant burger with a giant what I thought was an onion ring in the middle(it turns out this was a ring with fried cheese in the middle). The burger was a double patty with fried cheese in the middle and lettuce on the bottom. As I took a bite I realized the meat was undercooked and later I ended up getting sick from it later. I tried to bring the burger back after I had realized that the meat was undercooked and they said I could not give it back because I had taken a bite.

at this outdoor restaurant/lounge at the Grand California Hotel at the Disneyland Resort. Secondly, the atmospheric is idyllic. If you don‚Äôt want to spend the money to stay at this...gorgeous hotel, spending an evening at the Craftsman Grill makes you feel like you did for a few hours. You hear the splashing of the pool, the beautiful voice/instruments of the live entertainment, and enjoy the landscaping and lights sparkling from the ceiling. 

Our server was amazingly attentive for the manner in which he was scheduled to cover tables. It seems like there were only 2 servers and a long line. Also we saw our waiter helping customers at tables far from ours, so we conjectured that the lounge  restaurant table assignments were poorly strategized and the restaurant was understaffed. 

This fed into poor behavior on behalf of some of the very entitled clientele. I felt like the table next to us must have some relation to Marie Antoinette, as the group was so indifferent to the obvious suffering of the staff and demanded to see someone ‚Äúin charge‚Äù yo let them know that after a few minute wait, no one had yet visited their table.

I ate the chicken kebab plate, which was wonderful and enjoyed two drinks and my husband got sliders, which he said were excellent. They also had a great on tap beer selection. 

We hope this brand new culinary option stays open and refines its strategy for table service because already it is our favorite place to eat now at the resort by far. If it weren‚Äôt for the table service layout, I would give the restaurant 5 plus stars.More",September 2019,GCH Craftsman Grill

Same as the  ketchup at ketchup dispensers. 
although mixed reviews, we stopped here after spending the day at the beach. 
Prices are high, but food quality is low.  Fires are similar to the ones you buy in bulk at smart and final. We ordered a cheese burger fries and a salmon sandwich. Cheeseburger was not really tasty average at most. You can tell Just average ingredients. Not sure how can people say these are great burgers . 
Fries lack salt they were greasy and you could tell they are poor quality. 
Salmon was cooked properly, but seems they do not clean their grill often. It had a burnt flavor from the grill.  Everything is extra.  refills are0.50cents. 

Cashier, believe was the manager or owner was friendly, polite and very courteous. On the other hand, the guy handing out the food, just does not care. I told him he run out of ketchup.  He just simply looked at me a turn around and walked away.

The coleslaw is quite bland, not a vinegar or sweet style, not much flavor to it.  Good for a vegetable, but you can trade it for another piece of Texas Toast if you really crave the starch.

nickwarrilow,30.0,"Kids were bugging me to go to Canes after they visited the chain out in Ohio.

Best chicken you've ever tasted they said.

My kids loved it but I was a bit less impressed.

The portion size is huge so come with your appetite and...see if you can borrow someone else's because you get plenty to eat in a portion.

I actually shared a portion with my wife and were happy with our 1/2 share.

I am not going to be rushing back here since it took me 90-minutes to drive here (this is the closest location to me).More",December 2017,Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers
Hairycalgrad,50.0,"I was immediately impressed with how nice the exterior of the restaurant looks. Everything about this place is great, including the name because it was named after the founder's dog Cane.  The food was hot and came out fast. Chicken was tender, juicy, and crispy...but at first I thought it needed more spices. I then released why they did not have too many spices on the chicken, it was because their dipping sauce is really flavorful and so good. The meal was also a good price, very reasonable for all you get. We just wish there was a Raising Cane restaurant in Buena Park. We will be back.More",February 2018,Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers

On the above scale, (1-5) the fries rate at best, a 1/2. With a consistency somewhere between soft cardboard and clean t.p., they are almost tasteless.

I had come to order from the OctoberFest Menu.  A Brautwurst with Mustard and Sour Kraut. Not as good as Germany, and at a higher price point, but getting to Germany is expensive.  Then as I began to eat, I was at an outdoor table, a car parks, rather poorly, and the man of short stature gets out and opens the trunk.  He begins to lift out gallon cans of something, but six at a time, wrapped.  He takes them inside.  After the sixth and final, he gets a few other items and then is gone.

Robert D,30.0,"As a juror in a five-day trial at the Harbor Justice Center (on Jamboree Road at Birch Street in Newport Beach), I decided to eat lunch at five nearby cafes/fast food joints that were within walking distance (half-mile) from the Justice Center.

My criterion for judging these low-end categories is ‚Äúthe best quality for the least price.‚Äù In other words is it ‚Äútasty‚Äù and inexpensive. I am not a big fan of hot dogs, because as a kid, I eat too many, too often. At Wienerschnitzel, I ordered the new Grilled Bratwurst ($2.99) with sauerkraut and mustard. The bun was below average and the Bratwurst was average‚Äîall in all, not exciting. When considering taste and value, it does not measure up to the foot-long Polish Sausage and large soda ($1.60) sold at Costco.

Phil C,50.0,"In-N-Out's been consistent over the years making great burgers to-order without the fancy advertising or gimmicks. One of the great California burger joints that is a must-go-to. Shakes are classic hits, and I love the fresh fries hot or cold with pepper in my ketchup...or the INO dressing aka Animal Style. 

My go-to order is the Number 1 double-double with everything on it, chopped chilies and a whole sliced onion (sometimes grilled), extra crispy fries and an iced tea or vanilla shake. If I'm feeling the need for low-carb, I'll make it protein-style, lettuce instead of the bread bun. 

If you're dining in, it'll be best to park near Smart and Final or try your luck in the tiny IN-U-Out lot. Once inside, the atmosphere is casual and ordering from the counter is easy. The dining area is very small and can get very crowded during peak hours. 

The drive-thru has a system which locals already know, and if you're new to the area or visiting, the best way to enter the drive-thru is from Valley View Street. Follow the line of cars. I appreciate the person standing outside and taking the drive-thru orders as it feels more personable rather than talking through the intercom. 

I wish this place was bigger to accommodate all the customers comfortably. I usually visit during off peak hours, so I can get...in and out...quicker to enjoy my meal.More",March 2019,In-N-Out Burger

Wrong. Anything but typical. You have heard of Build a Bear? Well this is build a burger. 
You select size (one or two patties), Cheese (yes/no),...Bacon (yes/no) to start the process and these alter the price. Then you have a plethora of toppings that come at no additional charge, including Mayo, Lettuce, Pickles, Tomatoes, Grilled Onion, Grilled Mushrooms, Ketchup, Mustard, Relish, Onion, Jalape√±o Peppers, Green Peppers, Bar-B-Que Sauce, Hot Sauc,A1 Sauce.

Maybe the best french fries I have ever had and a large order was more than two us us could finish.

While waiting for you food, munch on all you can eat salted peanuts in the shells. Grab a bowl full on the way in.

You can order soft drinks including ice tea, milk shakes and sodas. That last dispensed from one of those kiosk machines that offers every darn thing including several we had never had before.

Nice, clean, organized place. People knew their rolls and did them well.

Pricey for burgers, but well worth it. Very good meat and accouterments. If allowed to crab a little, I would upgrade the buns. I found mine without adequate ""body"". It seemed moist enough but was still very very crumbly and left a mess on my lap and table.More",December 2017,Five Guys

There are times that they play music so loud you can barely think and then there are times it is tolerable. I think it is good to know that they charge top dollar for everything. A shake is over $5.00 which to me is ridiculous especially since they are very small. Their argument would be we use fresh high grade ingredients, still even though it is pretty high priced.

The food is consistently good and the service is really, really excellent. Great staff at this location. Friendly, helpful, attentive. They make the place enjoyable.

One item to mention: This is part of a strip mall at the intersection of MacArthur and Bristol and shares parking with several other small restaurants and other retail operations. On a Friday, parking here is nuts. Be prepared to park a bit of a distance and walk or park behind the restaurant on the east side of the lot against the wall separating the mall from the apartments (it can be a little sketchy back there).

AmigoMarlz,40.0,"Now this place was a really nice surprise!
Our expectations were not very high, but we wanted to grab a quick bite, and the queues at the nearby restaurants were longer.
Wow, the food here is delicious! Very fresh, tasty, and satisfying.
It's not a...great place to sit down and eat; the tables are small and a bit cramped (and our travelling party was large), but we loved it enough to come back here, all the same.
The freshness of the salads in the accompanying the meals, especially, appealed to my wife.
The structure of the menu, made it really easy for people to order just enough without having to order too much - and it's granular enough to let you sample a wide range, especially if you're in a crowd.

DrWendellW,20.0,"I used to see long lines at lunchtime, so I looked forward to giving it a try.

There were two large gyro on spits, so it looked promising.  However, the gyro sandwich was a big disappointment.  I‚Äôm used to having nice juicy strips of gyro...meat, but instead the sandwich had dry chopped up bits because it had been sitting in a pan for a while.  What a shame when they were carving up fresh strips only to be cut into smaller bits later.  The pita bread wasn‚Äôt warmed up or placed on a grill to crisp up the edges.  They offered an array of toppings which reminded me more of a Subway than a true gyro or swarma restaurant.  The tatziki sauce didn‚Äôt have much flavor.  Hot sauce was in packets.

On a good note, the side of falafel was very good.  The baklava looked fresh.  The staff was friendly and polite.

W6633PYpauls,40.0,"On my way home from work, I pulled in here to order take-out for my family. We've seen the restaurant and routinely drive by but never had a chance to stop by.

Overall, this is an above average place. The food is fine, the staff...is really great, the facility is clean and well kept and the prices are reasonable. Since it was my first visit, I simply ordered three combination plates to go so we could try both meats. On impulse, I also ordered the baklava. The combo's come with a ""white sauce"", bbq sauce, and a hot sauce. 

The meats are done properly and seasoned fine. Nothing to complain about. The ""white sauce"" is basically a mayonnaise which, if you use a lot, will get you feeling really full really fast. The bbq sauce is just that; nothing special. The hot sauce is very hot - over the top hot. I like my ""hot"" sauces to have a kick but this was one really powerful. 

Note that the place is located in a food-court strip mall. Lot's of small eateries. Which also means less than adequate parking. I would advise getting there early for dinner should you wish to eat here. I dropped in right at 5:00 PM and had no trouble finding a space but if you wait to go later be prepared to wait for a space (for a while).

In general, this is a decent, above average, place. Nothing special. I'm glad we tried it once but I don't think we'll go back.More",February 2018,The Halal Guys

Familylady22,10.0,"BEWARE THAT EMPLOYEES STEAL FROM CUSTOMERS. 

We mistakenly left our $250 sunglasses at the stand over the weekend. We called to verify that they were there, Robert the employee said that the sunglasses are in fact there and will be left in the office. 

We...went to PCH the next day, the sunglasses were no longer at the location. When I question the worker that was there, he said he would call the employee who was working (Robert). He called Robert and he said the glasses are in the office. Well the office was torn apart. After speaking to Robert for 10 min, the guy swore that the sunglasses would be at the stand. After I requested to view the security cameras footage and speak to the owner, the employee Robert said he would bring the sunglasses at that very moment. He admitted he took them, he said ""I brought them home so they wouldn't get broken."" If you left them in the office , they more than likely would have not been broken. The guy got caught and then changed his story. 

Unfortunately he lied about the sunglasses being in office. Then story changed  and he has them with him. 

It's petty theft at this point. I didn't want to make a big deal about sunglasses but we reached out to the Owner via call and text. The owner ignored our texts and called the store then called the employee. He never called us back to address the incident. 

I sat and waited for Robert to show up for 40 min, he brought the sunglasses back. I watched him as He went into the stand , went to the back office pretend to look, then pulled the sunglasses glasses out of his pocket. He handed them to the guy working. No apology, no explanation. Glasses are all scratched and smudged . He damaged personal property, 

What a coward, i have zero respect for PCH hot dogs. The fact the owner didn't reach out to apologize for his employee is so unprofessional. I have reached out 3 times to owner and have not gotten in response 

I will be filing a formal complaint with BBB & others. 
I called Orange PD to report petty theft as well 

Had the employee told the truth at first we could have avoid this all together. Had the owners reached out like a professional buisness man It would have calmed us down.

 Shame on your establishment, if an employee is willing to steal sunglasses maybe you should think about the trust you have in him. Might not be the first time he has stole from someone or your establishment.More",May 2019,Pacific Coast Hot Dogs

Scania144420,10.0,"Whilst staying at the Knott's Berry Farm Hotel, we decided to try this McDonald's for breakfast one morning for a change.

From the distance everything looked ok, but when you get closer to the building you find out how dirty the place is, it doesn't...look like the exterior of the building has ever been washed including the windows, then on entering the building it looked like a museum of McDonald's as it was so old and don't think it has been touched since it was built. The metal chairs were dirty and tables we wiped down ourselves, and the few seats that did have cushions were in a very poor state and ripped and in places even the wall paper is falling off. Only nice thing was the railroad train running around above your head.

Now onto placing our order that was the hardest part it took numerous attempts for the staff member to try and get the order correct and eventually her manager had to take over as she was struggling, but this isn't her fault and this goes down to poor training and I genuinely felt sorry for her.

So if you would like to visit a working McDonald's museum I recommend this branch, but please take antibacterial wipes or hand gel with you.More",August 2018,McDonald's

LucianoLeon,20.0,"I went to Del Taco because I was too lazy to go home and cook, didn't have much money, and happened to be in the area. 

I ordered a hamburger, known in Del Taco as the Del Burger, and a burrito. First off, Del Taco,...and even Taco Bell for that matter, don't really classify as authentic Mexican food. It's passable at best. A facsimile of the real thing. However, in situations where you need to get some food fast and don't have a lot of time, Del Taco fit the bill for me.

My meal was bland and boring. It fulfilled a need; to be full. However, it wasn't enjoyable. The burger was totally run of the mill. About as memorable as watching golf on television. The burrito sat in front of me on the table. It actually looked bored. It tasted as much. 

The wait staff that helped me was about as friendly as a truck driver just finishing a 14 hour drive, day. He was an older guy, older than me. Didn't say hello, didn't smile. Total rote, monotone speech. Even at a fast food place, it would be nice if people would at least make an effort to be friendly to a customer. It's really not my fault that this particular worker makes probably minimum wage and hates the fact that his supervisor is still a teenager, and is telling him what to do.

If I was in the same situation I was in when I ate here, I probably would eat here again. However, I would never consciously plan to eat at Del Taco. Hunger makes people do desperate things sometimes.More",January 2017,Del Taco

The frys are smaller, the size of the burger paddy has really shrunken and the prices have gone up to where there are places that taste just as good and give you more food for the same price.

LucianoLeon,20.0,"Firehouse Subs has pretty good tasting subs. No doubt about it. I've ordered the Hero and have been impressed by it's heft and taste. I can't say anything negative about the food.

However, a restaurant is only as good as it's service and when it...comes to service, Firehouse Subs sucks the Big One.

As a person who works from home, I oftentimes need to order our so I can keep myself in the zone. Someone had told me about Ubereats, so I tried them. The first time I used them, I ordered a sub from Firehouse. Excellent first experience. However, that was both the first and last positive experience I had with them.

Two times in a row I have ordered what can only be considered the simplest of meals. A sandwich, a bag of chips and a drink. Three items. I know pine combs that can count that high. Unfortunately, some of the employees at Firehouse Subs haven't learned to count that high. Or perhaps they are millennials, whose Helicopter Parents weren't around to complement them every ten minutes that they are doing an incredible job bagging take out orders. Without the lack of constant encouragement, they got depressed and simply forgot to pack a bag of chips.

Or perhaps the Fireshouse Manager neglected to give them a certificate of appreciation and a $2.00 an hour raise after a week of part time work and they went off their Zoloft and forgot to pack a bag of chips because they were feeling sad.

Maybe, just maybe, they thought they were too good to work at a sandwich shop because, with their plump resume of abilities and their almost superhuman skill set, they should be running their own hedge fund. Honest to fing god. 

Two times in a row somebody couldn't handle the responsibility of putting a bag of chips in a bag? Here's a thought for consumption. Why doesn't somebody check the orders before they leave? Here's another one, and again it's free! Why doesn't the driver who is delivering the sandwiches, carry a box of chips with them so when there is a screw up like this, they can simply reach behind to the back seat and grab a bag of chips for the irate customer who thought that ordering a three items take out order never thought that an order of such simplicity could be screwed up. Not once, but twice! In a row even.

Unbelievable. This kind of stuff should not be happening. It's inexcusable. The person/people responsible for such ineptness should  be kicked to the curb.

The mellow yet pungent flavor of the melted provolone cheese as it smothers the tantalizing juices from the saut√©ed sirloin steak makes for one divine marriage of flavors.

arturofranz,40.0,"Met up with my friend, Fei to catch up on all things considered.  Bruxie is a fast food take out with open air seating located on Glassell, north of the circle in the City of Orange.  It was Sunday, Mother's day and we choose Bruxie...to avoid the impaction of numerous over zealous mommy celebrants.  Bruxie was packed with a minor waiting line of 6 or more. However, the line moves fairly quickly.  I'm not sure if the crowd was due to M-Day...Just think this is a very popular niche fast food restaurant, specializing in all fried chicken related.

I had the Buttermilk Fried Chicken salad, quite good and presented unmixed in a large bowl with Romaine, Apple wood Smoked Bacon, Avocado, Egg, Tomato, Cheddar Cheese, Chives & Ranch Dressing.  

You get your ticket # and a waitress delivers your meal to your table in the open air or umbrella seating area. Condiment table is available for plastic utensils, S & P, various chili sauces.   Lately, I've been into the ""Chocula"" sauce which is not too spicy hot but has a nice tang. Works well with my salad. Got a side of buttermilk fried chicken steak which I took home for a later dinner snack. Ginger beer was a nice treat, a bit sweet but solved with adding some water....Good to go!

Unfortunately I didn't notice until after I had scanned my discount into the computer. Rather than delete the extra items she deleted the entire order and started again. The unfortunate consequence of this decision was that when it came time to again scan my discount, it was nowhere to be found. Apparently it was only good for one use.
The manager on duty came to help as I was now holding up the line. When I explained that I did have a discount, but no longer could access it, and that his order taker had seen it, I asked that he override the system and honor the offer.

And the hash browns that they added were not crispy at all and made the whole thing sort of mushy. I added pico de gallo to mine and it was good, but nothing special. Sorry John, but you're not the best in town. I will admit though, at $2 off the giant burrito was only $5.79.More",December 2016,John's Place

Marcia V,30.0,"This morning I awoke wanting some Hash Brown Potatoes.  So often they are cooked after being taking right out of the freezer and then plopped onto a grill.  When cooked that way they are often crispy (even sometimes burnt) on the outside, but still raw...in the center.  What to do?  The decision I made was to order them inside a breakfast burrito at John's.  If they turned out to be bad, why, then I would just eat everything else.  When the HUGE item was delivered by my seat I opened it up with a knife and fork . . . perfect.  The potatoes were cooked just right, and all the way through.

To start with, we heard so much about it from Claire in ‚ÄúSix Feet Under,‚Äù so we kind of felt obliged to pay a...visit. 

Soon enough, we realized that Taco Bell was one of the best, if not the best, food option we tried in States.

First of all, we were so surprised to see such low prices. For 2 burrito menus (with two tacos included in each meal) and two refill beverages, we paid only 10$. And the best part was that the quality of the food and the taste was unbelievably amazing.

The tacos were absolutely fresh and crunchy as they are supposed to be, with green mouthwatering veggies inside them! The burritos were such a cheese-dream and perfect in size! 

The Taco Bell we visited had a huge parking lot with many free spaces at the University Center. It was very clean and with nice interior decorations. 

The staff was very polite and our order came to us super-fast.

There is only one thing left to say, we LOVE Taco Bell!More",June 2014,Taco Bell

RonaldF593,30.0,"I enjoy burritos and tacos more than my wife, so when I have the opportunity to try different places, I do it. Two of my staples are a Chile Relleno Burrito, and a hard shell beef taco. Comparing the burrito to other restaurants, this one...was less expensive, had less cheese, a smaller amount of the green Chile, with a majority of re fried beans and a little rice. It was wrapped in a flour tortilla, but only warm when I ate it. I like my food on the hot side. The burrito, I'd say was only average in taste and quality, and more of a bean burrito than a Chile Relleno. The beef taco, I'm sorry to say, was in the same average category. Watch the price, as you'll pay about fifty cents more than the posted drive thru price, which was $3.99. The taco was average size, the beef, while not ground, seemed over cooked and mushy. It was topped with a large amount of shredded lettuce, and a small amount of cheese, but no diced tomato. Cost was kind of high for what you got, at $2.49. Total bill for two items with tax was $6.98. A tip cup is placed directly on the drive thru window ledge, which is tacky.

The place was clean and apparently popular. We got there at 1:30 pm on a Saturday and barely found a place to sit down and eat. There aren't a lot of tables and such but that's okay. I wasn't looking for a McDonald's experience.

Tom M,10.0,"This review is about my first visit to this Subway location on December 2, 2019.  I ordered a 6 inch cold cut combo.  The lady started to make a tuna.  I again asked for a cold cut combo which she then proceeded to make.  I...was charged $6.18 for the 6 inch sandwich and 1 bag of chips.  After I paid and was leaving, I noticed a sign on the window stating that 6 inch cold cut combos are $2.50 through the end of the year.  Not sure how I was charged $6.18 for a $2.50 sandwich plus a bag of chips.  Also, the lady told me there are no rest rooms for customers.  So if you want to wash your hands before or after you eat, Starbucks is across the street.  This was my first and last visit to this location.More",December 2019,Subway

1txfishbutt,30.0,"Stopped in for a take-out lunch to eat at the harbor. The food was what I wanted and expected, typical Subway good quality. The folks working are in dire need of some coaching, or failing that need to find a different line of work. Probably...the least friendly people we encountered during our time in the area. It wasn't like a Soup-Nazi agressive attitude but almost a passive agressive rudeness, as if they were just too lazy for anything else. The customer before me had been told that the store was out of a certain bread, so when my turn came, I asked what choices of bread were available. The woman behind the counter gave me a disgusted look and pointed at the sign listing the options, but wouldn't speak. While making my sandwiches, she seemed to be wishing that she was anywhere but at work.She started wrapping up a sandwich before adding some requested mustard, and when I asked if she could please put some mustard on, I was again rewarded with ""the look"". She rang up the food, I paid, got my change and left. I'm pretty sure the only words uttered from a Subway employee were to the effect of ""what are you having today"". Look, I get that maybe it's not their dream job, but at least in this instance, the Subway employees did not represent the company favorably. To their credit, the subs tasted good.More",November 2013,Subway

After we placed our order for our chicken sandwiches, we got our table number and got us a table. The tables were rather clean. I noticed there were a lot of students eating here. I am told it is because Biola University is close by. 

After about five minutes or so, we got our food. I ordered the deluxe chicken sandwich with a side of guacamole. The buns and meat were cooked to perfection. The lettuce and tomato were fresh. The fries were not crispy as I would like, but I still enjoy them. 

After we finished eating our meal, we decided to get some dessert on the way out. Time for some cookies and cream milkshakes.

The fries were a bit dry, but made from real, fresh potatoes (I even saw some staff wheeling in containers full of peeled potatoes into the kitchen). My wife and daughters loved these.

Sammyjo225,50.0,"My husband and I are from Southern California and are currently traveling the nation to find and experience the best food around. We‚Äôd been to Cali Taco‚Äôs once before leaving for our travels and tested out some of their crazy delicious food, but on our...recent flight back to CA for some meetings we knew we had to visit again..

We are SO GLAD we did! Prior to our visit we learned a little bit about the owner Josh and the family story behind this awesome place! He grew up in the taco shop and started as a kid picking rocks out of the rice while also helping to make their delish homemade salsa! 

San Diego taco shops are way different then any other taco shop you‚Äôve ever experienced and he has officially brought San Diego to the OC. Everything is made fresh daily from their beans to their rice. Say hello to flavor!! You can taste the knowledge, passion and love behind each and every creation! Because he takes pride in what he does and wants to ensure a memorable decadent experience for all he even gets his meats and extra large 16inch Tortillas shipped from San Diego!! Wow oh wow talk about even more authentic!!!

They legit have a burrito that might as well be a baby you cradle and is the size of your forearm called the Angel burrito that is their surf and turf burrito with fries and all the works plus uses two of their special XL tortillas! Their meat is so tender, juicy and flavorful, the tortillas have the perfect softness and chew while also holding together when you eat it. They have a sauce they use called their Cali sauce and honestly it might as well be crack! It is SO FREAKEN GOOD and addicting! I wish they would bottle and sell it nationwide cause I‚Äôd put it on everything!!

The fish tacos were so flakey and crunchy and the fillet was massive. The Rolled tacos were super crunchy as well, the adobada OMG please sell that by the pound as well! The ham and egg breakfast burrito you could have for breakfast and lunch, their fries topped with all their homemade creations‚Ä¶dear lord everything is amazing!

They have another crazy creation called the FTB (Fries, Taco, Burrito) that was basically a massive 16 inch quesadilla bowl filled with your hearts desires as well‚Ä¶guacamole, fries, meat, sour cream, their crack Cali sauce, whatever meat you wanted (get it with adobada‚Ä¶you thank us!!), etc‚Ä¶.

Cali Taco‚Äôs is LEGIT a Destination spot, whether you‚Äôre inside the area or have to make a plane trip there. You MUST check them out and check it off your bucket list!!

The shop is small on the inside, and currently no inside dining cause of Covid, but they have a wonderful covered patio on the outside where you can enjoy all your deliciousness. 

Thank you Cali Tacos for giving an incredible experience to the world! We definitely need to bring Cali Tacos to the East Coast so everyone knows where the most LEGIT tacos come from!

cybertraveler,30.0,"Cali Tacos needs an restaurant intervention.  The food itself was very tasty and large portions - although my fish taco was so full it made it super hard to eat.  Cali burrito was HUGE!!  But they need help.
Staff: woefully slow and understaffed - the...line was one person ahead of us when we arrived and out the door by the time our order was processed and we were getting our drinks (and no we were not being dramatically slow deciding), I don't know why it took so long to take each person's order - but partially it was that the gal kept getting interrupted by other customers who needed things - like "" can I get a knife"", ""are there any lids for the cups"", ""we need sauce"", etc.  There was a guy who brought out food from kitchen but other than that we saw no one else and it was dinner time on a Friday night.  And the food took a long time to arrive for that size of menu. With experience from their other locations - they should be pumping the food out faster.
Decor:  Oh dear - someone head to the thrift store and grab some vintage surfer posters, some old California license plates, a few beat up surf boards - something, anything!!! The place is so bare and unappealing - it's clean but stark and boring with one tiny surf board by the order counter.  We ate on patio as that at least had some patio lights and greenery to look at.  
Beer:  We went online ahead of visit and saw on Yelp that they had local beers on tap - it was so hot and I was looking forward to a nice cold one with my food....they have taps on the wall like the photo BUT they apparently don't have a liquor license yet.  I hope it comes soon, I really felt cheated that night.

Overall - don't go if you are not hungry, if you are in a hurry or want a cold beer.  DO GO if you like big tasty portions of Californian Mexican fusion food and don't mind a bit of a wait and have someone to talk to rather than just stare at blank walls! :)More",August 2018,Cali Tacos
559MoM,30.0,"The portions are ridiculous here! The prices were fair considering there was more to the dish than beans and rice. Actually, there were no beans (on our plates anyway). It was mid morning and we were hungry! Stopped here by recommendation. We weren‚Äôt disappointed or...hungry when we left. Service was fast, very friendly and welcoming. 

The place was clean. Seating was tight but it‚Äôs in a strip mall. There were all types here and a line! We ordered the Angel Burrito filled with asada, shrimp, rice AND fries! What?! It was great but it fed 3 people. The rolled tacos were great and came w guac. Their regular sort of street tacos were huge and overflowing with meat! Now we know for next time we will share plates instead of ordering for each. The flavor was a good 7 out of 10. We added a drink and food for a family of 5 came to $27. We will come back!

With an hour on my hands I could have gone to any of the way better Mexican joints around (and probably eaten the food too).

We tried the Dr Pepper, root beer, sprite and finally the water. They were all awful. Another customer asked...me if I had found anything good to drink as his family was also searching for an acceptable beverage. 
We came during the 5:30pm rush, there were a few others in line, which seemed like a good sign. The gal that took our order was a total ditz. Seemed unable to focus or think. They messed up our simple order, so we had to re order what they had missed.

My mother had gone to the one in Mission Viejo and got some but I have quite a...few nephews.  When I got here, there was a long line in the drive through.  Their lobby was closed due to construction.  There was no sign or anything and I noticed people parking farther away and walking up to find out that they couldn't go inside.  I was upset because it took 35 minutes in the drive thru to get a dozen donuts!  The way everything was laid out, once you were in the line, it was almost impossible to change your mind because you could get out of the line to turn around and leave!  After waiting 35 minutes and receiving the donuts, what they looked like wasn't even close to any pictures or the donuts my mom picked up at the other Krispy Kreme.  For $16 (the cost of 1/2 mars and 1/2 glazed donuts - they wouldn't let you buy just the mars donuts) I was expecting a better looking donuts.

geraldr507,30.0,"COASTAL TRIO TACOS

Last week my company, which is located in SF, sent me down to the Anaheim office to help train two new employees. Thursday was the second day working at the Anaheim office. My coworkers asked me where I wanted to eat for...lunch. I suggested Rubio's. The week before I left for Anaheim I looked at places to eat that were either near the Anaheim office or near the hotel I was staying at. The day before on Wednesday for lunch coworkers took me out for lunch at JT Schmid's, which was a couple minutes drive away from the office. Rubio's is even closer as it was across the street from the office. I read through Yelp reviews about The Original Fish Taco, which is a breaded, deep fried fish. I've had breaded, deep fried fish before and I found the breading tended to be soggy. On the website of Rubio's I noticed listed in the menu was The Coastal Trio, which consists the tacos of The Original Fish Taco, salsa verde, and grilled talapia. I ordered this combination of tacos so I can compare each taco with respect to taste.

The first taco I ate was the salsa verde shrimp taco. The shrimp with the salsa verde sauce was delicious. The second taco I ate was The Original Taco. I wondered what the hype was. The verdict is this is the best breaded, deep fried fish on a taco I've ever had. The breaded is crispy but not oily. The fish isn't overcooked. The cabbage soaks up the oil from the breading. In addition the cabbage and deep fried fish add a crunch texture. So far The Coastal Trio is 2 for 2 in terms of taste. The next taco was the grilled talapia. Would the grilled talapia make The Coastal Trio 3 for 3? Out of the three this was the worst. The meat on the talapia was slightly overcooked. In addition it lacked flavor. Even though I liked the salsa verde shrimp taco I would rather have three Original Fish Tacos as combo instead of three different types of tacos and that's the reason why I gave this rating I did. If I do come back to Rubio's I would order items that are breaded and deep fried.More",January 2017,Rubio's

This place is clean with a nice trendy fresh ambiance.  Dine in is clean and spacious. 
Food is decent good flavor and consistent.  Good big portions, but not necessarily cheap. 

They have combination plates, tacos, burritos, quesadillas, tostadas, tacos salads. 

Also have breakfast options  Mexican or American like scrambled eggs
Their famous burrito here is the garbage burrito.  It is a loaded burrito with all the good stuff and your choice of meat. (Chicken, pork, shredded beef, carne asada). 
You can make it a wet burrito for additional charge. Red sauce over it with shredded cheese.  This would be a great choice
Another favorite is the Chile verde platter. Chile verde with rice and beans.

The one dish most of us ordered was the fish tacos for which Rubio's is famous, but for this visit they were cold and unappetizing.

It was only after we pounded on the door that someone finally came back and opened the door to complete our orders.

Drinks are sodas from a dispenser if you like...that style.  They have bushels of peanuts in the shell that you can take to your table and shuck them and eat as much as you can stand. Free of charge on the peanuts.  Kids love it, and you can either drop the shells on the floor, table or nut containers.  You decide, no one cares.  The place is clean, a bit noisy, but that adds to the atmosphere of a friendly place.

We also get an order of the cheesy fries (thick steak cut yummies with provolone melted on top) and the kids always grab a creme soda or root beer from the mini fridge by the order window (brew bakers local brewing makes them for johns).

Jim W,10.0,"Very disappointed with my recent experiences with this place. The website breaks down a great deal and refuses to accept standard debit or credit cards. Then you're forced to call the call center to place an order, which I had to do again. After waiting...on hold several minutes, someone came on the line, took my order, confirmed it, took my credit card information, and told me when the order would be ready. I went to the store and was on time, but they had no record of my order whatsoever. The manager was very rude, curt and disrespectful, claiming that he would take no responsibility for what happened. He was dismissive and turned his back on me several times. I was both angry and frustrated since this was not the first time this has happened. He told me it would take another 7 to 10 minutes to make my order, but I was reluctant to have to wait as I had a Lyft ride out front waiting to give me a ride back to my home. At one point, because he didn't like the fact I was frustrated, he had the audacity to threaten to refuse to serve me at all. I was ready to walk out the door but he then came to his senses and went ahead and rushed the order. I was so upset when I left that I could not finish eating the food when I got home because I was so aggravated with the poor management attitude and the fact that my order never arrived at the store to begin with. Their food is pretty decent which is why I have continued to go back there, but I will no longer do business with The Habit until they get their collective act together ... meaning the website working properly, and friendly operators able to take an order over the phone and ensure that it gets sent to the store.

The two tacos were bursting with flavor and remained hot in the aluminum wrappers used for preparing ""to go"" orders.

The counter staff was friendly, efficient and courteous. If you have any questions, ask them. They will answer your questions.

The only reason I deducted one star was due to the limited seating areas for eating your meal and the scarcity of available parking spaces in the strip mall.

I got the Combo #4 (2 Carne Asada tacos) and swapped the meats.....They do that if you ask, otherwise the fish taco plate is #3 and you get 1 taco. They were packed with lots of fish, no skimpy tacos here, cabbage, sauce and Pico de Gallo, refried beans and rice. The rice tasted like basic boxed rice, definitely nothing worthy of any attention.. The beans were very good and flavorful, but the tacos.. Oh the tacos.. They were delicious! Highly recommend them!

My wife got the #2, rolled tacos plate. They were tasty no doubt, but literally dripping with fryer oil. No joke, straight dripping... as if they took em straight from the fryer and dropped into the box with no draining. If they'd tasted anything less than great, I'd have dropped another star, which was the reason for the dropped one already. The rice being blah didn't account for the 1 star ding, but if you're set in good rice, look elsewhere.

There are two taco options - crispy taco with chicken or beef and carne asada street tacos with small soft tortillas. The tacos are ok only. With so many authentic Mexican dining options in Tustin such as Jalapeno's, La Sirena Grrill, El Toro Bravo and Los Cotijas, why would you go to Miguel's unless you want a drive through.

ArchieMYL,40.0,"I only come here a few times a year, only when I'm taking my wife's car in for service at the local Hyundai dealer. It's walking distance, so why not. 

The site is a fast-food looking restaurant, with drive-thru an all. My favorite dish is...the carne asada tacos meal which comes with rice and beans. As stated in the title, pricing is a bit expensive for what you get (two soft tacos, small portions of rice & beans), but it is very very good. Food is cooked to order. Of course they have a salsa bar and soft drink fountain. I use a touch of their classic hot sauce just to enhance the flavor a bit, but it;s probably not needed. The carne asada is just SO good.

The site serves breakfast as well, opening I believe at 7 am. Even though I usually get there about 9-ish I haven't tried their breakfast selections yet. Hopefully I will if I can talk myself out of the tacos.More",October 2017,Miguel's Jr

When I finally arrived at the...front of the line to place my order, I ordered a regular crust pizza, with classic red sauce and extra mozzarella cheese.  The pizza was fast-fired quickly and provided to me with a friendly smile.  The counter staff was excellent - thank you to all of them!

The crust of the pizza was slightly thicker than its competitors, but well-flavored.  There was plenty of mozzarella cheese, much more than I anticipated, so that was a bonus.  The classic red sauce was flavorful.  The price was also lower than other fast-fired pizzerias in the OC.

The pizza was very good (although I prefer a thinner crust - just my personal preference - and not a criticism of Blaze Pizzeria at all).  

Bottom Line: although I liked the pizza, I am not sure I would be willing to return in the future: it's way too crowded; and it was nearly impossible to find parking for my car.]More",October 2017,Blaze Pizza

LeoS3107,30.0,"Had breakfast at this location last Saturday,12-9-17, and I had a couple of problems.The crew seemed very busy, and another customer and myself were ready to order. There was no one taking orders, but it seemed the drive thru was being well taken care of....Finally a young man named Christian saw we were waiting and took our orders. I ordered the bacon and eggs breakfast with a decaf coffee. I was told there was no decaf on, but they would make some right away. Ten minutes later I could plainly see there was no decaf being made. I asked Christian and he said he would make some , to which I replied no thanks just give me an ice tea. A very few minutes later another crew member brought me some decaf. Too little too late. I knew several cars had been through the drive thru so I asked the crew member to check on my breakfast, which he brought back in another few minutes. Eggs were OK as were potatoes and toast, but the bacon was limp, greasy and fatty. Pretty bad. I seldom come to F.B. for breakfast so this was a trial visit.

I've never had a bad experience with the quality and taste of the food here; however, this time my tri-tip shawarma wrap was prepared in a substandard manner: beef instead of tender was chewy, the pita bread was burnt so it would flake off when handled, and to add insult to injury the wrap was more like a mini-wrap (it was so small). 
We ordered a whole chicken to-go, also, and instead of it coming in a ""thermal bag"" (combo paper/aluminum foil?) that was used in the past, now it comes in a plastic container that I doubt can keep the bird warm for later consumption. 
I'm not sure if it was because of the hour, the time of the year, the location, or simply that quality was overlooked,  but this seemed like an anomaly. During my time at this restaurant trying to enjoy my meal, I observed several patrons not necessarily happy with their orders, or the service.

In the second stage, you have your choice of a wide variety of meats. At this place, you make the pizza exactly how you want it, and there doesn't seem to be a limit as to how much/little you put on it.

We have very different tastes in pizza, so this is great...way for each of us to get what we enjoy most on our pizza.  Also, they are thin crust pizzas, which we both prefer!  I always think my pizza is more tasty than hers, and she thinks her pizza is more tasty than mine!  We are both right since we had them made just the way we want a pizza!  The pizza makers are very polite and friendly, and are also accommodating to second handfuls of a topping, or to pushing the ingredients to the edge!  We are able to make two meals each out of our two individual pizzas!More",October 2017,Pizza Studio - Buena Park

Employee asked over PA (speaker) how I wanted my eggs, I said scrambled, and what toast, I said sourdough. She then quoted a price of something like $9.65....I drove forward, looked at my wife and said $9 for a breakfast sandwich? I also said, I never remember how I wanted my eggs or what toast on a sandwich. No one was behind me, so I reverse the car, and asked for her to repeat my order. It was wrong. She had thought I ordered a complete breakfast plate. I repeated my order, and she corrected price to $7.54. As I recall, all breakfast sandwiches come with scrambled egg, meat choice, mayo., tomato and lettuce. She repeated order at window. I paid, and looked at receipt, which had original order, but sand. marked in ink over it. We got sandwich and took home to eat, a few miles from  restaurant. When we opened the sandwich, rather than finding the scrambled egg with a commplete hot link sliced and separate, we found it to be chopped finely up and added to the egg mixture. Never had it this way before. Not at all satisfied. Will NOT return to this place. Extremely disappointed. Regular BS with meat (other than hot links is 5.50).

The taquitos were wonderful - nicely seasoned without being too spicy, and the guacamole that came with them was excellent! 

A nice, fat, bean and cheese burrito with some fresh salsa in it was fantastic as well!

Reid F. K,40.0,"So for some time now I have been told that I should go and check out Chipotle Mexican Grill. I love Mexican food, but there are so many good places to go that I just never got around to going until today. The d√©cor is...modern lite industrial and everything is neat a clean. The process of ordering is really simple, you start at one end of the ordering area, tell the staff, who are super helpful and really friendly, what you want (IE. taco, burrito, tostada etc...). Then you tell them what you want on your order (IE. cheese, sour cream, hot sauce, etc...) they wrap it all up and voila, your order is ready. 
The real option here is what meat to select for the items you desire. My first time in I wanted to try it all, but since that was not an option, I selected a ""big burrito."" I wanted both steak and chicken as the smell of both permeated the air. The girl behind the counter asked if I wanted that 50/50 or double, meaning a full load of each type of meat. The manager was standing there and had obviously heard me say that I had never been into a Chipotle before, and recommended the double meat, so I went with it. I got my order to go and when I got home and started in on my big burrito I was pleasantly surprised. 
The taste was that of fresh food, not the processed and frozen stuff you get at other Mexican fast food chains, who shall remain nameless.

IWillReviewForYou,30.0,"decent pricing for a food store located inside hilton anaheim. was expecting prices to be crazy since it was onsite but it was actually really good.

burger tasted awesome. had their spicy fries which was ok, not really spicy at all. if you ever had...hot n juicy spicy fries then those are spicy fries and not the ones at this place but gives you something different from regular fries so its ok.

tried their spicy canjun sausage sandwhich. pretty much something like a johnsonville smoked sausage cut up and with some cajun seasonings onions etc. was only $5 for that and it taste very very good. got a nice tiny kick to it and also something different so if your looking for something new or out of the usual, would recommend it.More",November 2018,Just Grillin' Express

There is indoor and outdoor seating here. Go down the like and request what you...want. I like the chicken bowl. Though I've had quantity issues with some times. It just depends on the person preparing the bowl for you . Usually its 3-4 people who get a hold of your bowl as it goes down the line. Sometimes I've had a guy put half a spoon of rice for my bowl and just spread it at the bottom so it looks like a lot, and some times they just skim the top of the chicken bits and sprinkle it in your bowl. Just depends on how heavy or light the hand is of the person digging in. I've had to tell them a couple of times to add more rice and more chicken. Guac is $1.50 extra. I dont normally get it but fyi. I just get my bowl with white rice, chicken, black beans, mild and medium, sour cream and cheese.

OCFoodDiva,40.0,"The Rib Plate is Korean-style marinated short ribs atop your choice of white or brown rice, and served with salad and fruit garnish. The short ribs were pretty good for fast food. The ribs were definitely marinated for quite a while as the flavor penetrated...the meat really well, tasting almost like teriyaki. You feel your carnivorous side come out as you gnaw on the bone to get each piece of meat off. I prefer the brown rice as it has more flavor than just white rice. A little bit a shoyu (soy sauce) and/or ‚ÄúHappy Sauce‚Äù and you‚Äôre good to go. The salad was fresh and house sesame supreme dressing was very good. Thumbs up!

The Half & Half Plate is beef and chicken with the same choices as above. If you can‚Äôt make up your mind, the Chicken and Beef Plate is the way to go. They give you a lot of meat on the plate dishes so you‚Äôll definitely get your fill of protein. The chicken is okay on its own, but once you top it with some the Happy Sauce, it‚Äôs amazing! The Happy Sauce really does make everything happy whether it is meat, vegetables, or rice. The beef was perfectly marinated and cooked. It was just great all by itself with some rice.

surferdoc,30.0,"I ordered a plain cheese pizza, after seeing a movie at the theater in the same mall.

The best part of the pizza was its crispy thin crust (because I really like thin-crusted pizzas).  So, the crispy thin crust receives 5 stars from me.

However,...the red sauce was skimpy and the mozzarella cheese topping was not abundant even though I specifically requested extra cheese on my pizza.  Plus, I had to wait a long time to receive my pizza even though Pieology didn't seem very crowded at the time.  The pizza was slightly more expensive than its competitors.  For those reasons, I deducted 2 stars from this review. Otherwise, the pizza was okay.More",October 2017,"Pieology Pizzeria Spectrum, Irvine, CA"

I ordered a single burger, some truffle fries, and a shake.  A tasty...and filling meal, it was a little on the costly side (particularly for the shake that was over almost $5).  Service was quick (it wasn't very crowded at 5:30pm) and the food was served to my table fairly quickly.  

There is a patio outside (there is a gate around this area, so it's a little confusing when you walk up to the door...you have to open the gate and walk through the patio to get into the restaurant) so you can sit outside with the kids.  The atmosphere in the restaurant was nice and the service was quick and friendly.

Suzanne R,30.0,"Baja Fresh has really dropped their standard of food, portions and prices. Way back when, their cheese quesadilla used to be a very large flour tortilla cut into generous pie sliced shapes, served with large scoops of pico di gallo, sour cream and guacamole. For...the last several years, I keep hoping they'll revert back to the original way they used to prepare the quesadillas but they disappoint every time. The plate is small and looks bear. There is no pico di gallo on the plate - they expect you to get it yourself; there is a small tablespoon size of sour cream and a negligible amount of guacamole. I get it that food ingredients cost, but to skimp on basic items that make or break the dish, it really shouldn't have been modified. You have to ask for chips and are handed a mini bag, not the regular size bag they used to give. The budget cutbacks are so obvious at Baja Fresh that it really affects the whole dining experience. What used to be my favorite go-to restaurant for Mexican food has really down-graded into a place I don't think I'll return to anytime soon.More",January 2020,Baja Fresh

BruinDan,40.0,"Baja Fresh is an international chain of fast-casual Tex-Mex restaurants; this particular location can be found in the food court area of the sprawling Irvine Marketplace, toward the north (Irvine Boulevard) end of the Marketplace.  There is plentiful free parking available, but note that it...can become very busy, particularly on weekends.  The dining room is decent-sized with booths and tables, and there is a good deal of seating in the shared outdoor patio.  Like all Baja Fresh restaurants, this unit features an excellent, extensive salsa bar.

I‚Äôve eaten at this location numerous times over the years and I‚Äôve found their food to be true to their name, as everything does taste fresh.  On this occasion I tried something different than my normal order, their barbecue chicken salad.  It definitely had a south-of-the-border element to it as the barbecue sauce was less sweet and tasted like one of its ingredients was picante sauce; I enjoyed it.  The service was acceptably friendly and efficient, and the dining room was reasonably clean.

caneguy,40.0,"Sitting on PCH in South Laguna Beach is this small street style taco shop.  Having passed by this place more times than I can count, with my son‚Äôs in town we decided to check out the tacos for a quick bite.  Looking over the posted...menu we each got a carne asada street taco to hold us over until we stopped at another place for lunch.  Listed price for the taco was $2.95 and when presented the total, I did not think twice and paid the amount.  The tacos were good, not great and would have been well worth the $2.95.  After eating the tacos, I realized that the total amount was much more than what should have been for the 3 tacos we ordered.  I asked the nice person inside the window about the price and he said that was for a large taco.  OK, no problem but we did not order the large one (did not even see it on the menu) and I thought I should have been told we were getting that size when he took the order (just asked for the carne asada tacos).  SO, will I be back, maybe not.  Not so much for the up-charge but I find the food across the street at Coyote Grill much better (even if a little more costly).More",December 2017,Papa's Tacos

We don't debate about it, we just devour them. There are so many savory choices for lunch and great flavored teas and boba drinks.

Daniko8,20.0,"A friend and I had a long drive to Santa Barbara, so we decided to stop by THH and get some food for the car ride.

He gave us a dirty look and replied, ""You need to order more!""

Our order was well over $10 and I mentioned we were paying in cash, so I'm not sure of the reason for his rudeness.

We ended up waiting 20 minutes and saw many people behind us in line receive their orders and finish their meals. After approaching the employees and inquiring about our sandwiches, they finally had our food ready a few minutes later.

Although it doesn't make up for the bad experience, a small consolation was that the House Special (baguette with cold cuts and pate) was decent.More",July 2015,THH Sandwiches & Coffee
BruinDan,40.0,"For the average American, trying a new type of cuisine can be daunting.  Asian cuisine in particular can have hard-to-pronounce menu items with unfamiliar ingredients that are more than a little intimidating.  The key to expanding the cuisine to mainstream diners is to find and...market dishes that are easy for the American palate to accept.  Decades ago Americans discovered Mexican tacos, Japanese teriyaki and Chinese chop suey (which is not even Chinese), and eventually began delving deeper into those cuisines.  Now, Mexican, Japanese and Chinese food are practically staples of the American diet.  In terms of Vietnamese food, two dishes that are a good gateway for Americans to that cuisine are pho (a delicious noodle soup) and banh mi (Vietnamese sandwiches).

Tan Hoang Huang (THH) Sandwiches specializes in banh mi (which is a Vietnamese term for bread).  These sandwiches carry over influences from Vietnam‚Äôs days as a French colony as they are served on a baguette and include a bit of pate.  Most of the fillings are pretty familiar, like sausage, cold cuts, ham, barbeque pork or meatball.  If you feel adventurous you can try fillings like sardine, fish cake or pork skin.  All the sandwiches are topped with cilantro, cucumbers, pickled root vegetables and jalapeno (easily removable if you don‚Äôt want heat), which give the sandwich a marvelous crunch and that element of freshness that Vietnamese food is known for.

For those of you who don‚Äôt like feeling like an outsider in ethnic restaurants (but don‚Äôt want to admit it out loud), it should be noted that all the employees speak English fluently and about half the clientele is non-Asian.  So, there really is no excuse for trying a banh mi at THH ‚Äì you will definitely not regret it!More",November 2015,THH Sandwiches & Coffee
NJTravellingfool,40.0,"After a long flight from the east coast to Orange County, we wanted to have a Banh Mi for lunch. In this strip mall, we decided to stop at THH at its Tustin location for lunch. We had a classic Banh Mi (Dac Biet) and...a Roasted Pork banh mi with drinks. You place your order and immediately someone is preparing your sandwich and you can watch the job. The baguette is nice and fresh with the hard crust on top and plenty of crumb from each bit. The classic has the pate and meat with fresh cilantro and jalapeno with crunchy radish. The pork is thin sliced, moist and with a slightly sweet hoisin like marinade. 

We had a passion fruit boba drink that was ice cold and delightfully tart and a deep rich Vietnamese iced coffee to round out the meal. From placing our order at the counter, to receiving our food was only a few minutes and we could watch the preparation as well.More",November 2015,THH Sandwiches & Coffee

I will have to say that I was a bit disappointed that their Banh MI was a bit bland, but the ingredients were fresh, and the prices are fantastic.

Al G,30.0,"The concept of Spoleto Italian was interesting with the speed fast food combined with a very interesting menu, including pastas, risottos, sandwiches, and roast dinners.

Speed was attained by pre-cooking the components and then combining them to order. The process worked reasonably well producing passable...meals: risotto and spaghetti. The roast chicken, however, was dry and the accompanying broccoli was well beyond it's ""serve before"" time.

When informed, the staff apologized and provided a complementary desert.

Another slight quibble, several times during our meal the serving staff shouted out, apparently in glee, perhaps when a particular item was ordered. We found this unexpected noise bothersome.

BruinDan,40.0,"Taqueria de Anda is a family-owned chain of six quick service restaurants in north and central Orange County.  The Fullerton location can be found at the corner of Valencia Drive and Highland Avenue.

In many areas outside the southwestern United States, people often think of...tacos as having a crunchy, deep-fried shell and filled with seasoned ground beef, iceberg lettuce and shredded yellow cheese.  Genuine tacos are actually small, soft, hand-sized tortillas filled with meats like carne asada (chopped steak), al pastor (spit-roasted pork) or pollo (chicken), and garnished with lime, cilantro, onions, salsa and Cotija cheese ‚Äì these are the kind of tacos you‚Äôll find at Taqueria de Anda.

You can tell that a taco stand hasn‚Äôt been overly Americanized when they offer taco fillings like lengua (beef tongue), cabeza (beef head) and buche (pork stomach).  Being curious, I had to try all three (as mentioned earlier, the tacos are rather small).  The buche had a slight organ flavor that I did not find off-putting.  The lengua and cabeza were both very beefy and flavorful; I would definitely order them again.  My family members were quite happy with their carne asada and al pastor tacos and burritos.

The service was efficient if not overly chatty (English is a second language for many of those working here).  The dining room, though tidy, seemed a bit dingy; it may have had something to do with the lighting.  Whatever the reason, it wouldn‚Äôt stop us from returning as the tacos are definitely worth the visit.More",March 2018,Taqueria de Anda

If it was good enough for the US president, it was good enough for me, and the In-And-Out Burger I'd tried on the Coachella road trip needed a challenger. It was plain to see how the chain had received so many awards, as there is a strong emphasis on simplicity and freshness. The unlimited free peanuts to snack on whilst waiting for your meal was also an interesting touch.""

FrankofGoodyear,20.0,"Went there with a friend after Angels game.  Restaurant not too busy inside.  Steady at drive thru.  You can either order at kiosk or at counter.  I opted to order at counter as I was paying with cash.  The manager was at the register.  A...very sullen looking lady with a wrist brace on.  She neither looked at me, nor acknowledged me and just walked away.  I then ordered at the kiosk, was given a receipt from the machine and had to walk back to the register to pay.  A young employee walked up, stared at me and I said I have to pay for this.  He gave me my change and said nothing.  No thanks.  Nothing.  I asked for my cup, got my drink and  walked through the un mopped and sticky floors to a table.  I have no idea why I stayed there.  Food showed up after 5 minutes.  It was fine.  I understand it can be stressful working in a busy restaurant.  The staff here just simply gave up on life and their jobs.  I shan't return to this establishment.More",August 2018,McDonald's

I know they offer other food other than the burger, but darn if I ever get to try it as I am always ordering the burger! It‚Äôs that good, people. Trust me. Trust me. Honestly, it puts all other burgers to shame. Bacon? Check. Quality melt in your mouth beef? Check. Pineapple? Check. Tasty aioli sauce that tastes like the nectar of the gods, uh huh.

Connie B,40.0,I've been to this restaurant a few times and the food there is always good and the restaurant itself is kept pretty clean.,June 2016,El Pollo Loco
LucianoLeon,50.0,"When I say El Pollo Loco is the healthiest fast food restaurant in Orange County, I'm talking about all of them, not just the one at 501 N. Placentia. It's a place to go to if you are in a rush, super hungry, but aren't...in the mood for a hamburger and fries.

El Pollo Loco has quite a lot of food choices, albeit they all have chicken in the recipe somewhere. My go to order is usually the three piece chicken combo, (thighs and leg) with two sides of pinto beans and a diet coke. It's almost always good. I have to say almost always good because when you go really makes a difference in the quality of the chicken.

For example, if you go on off times like after lunch or middle of the afternoon, the chicken often times does not have the same taste, texture or consistency as it does right before lunch or before dinner. It tastes like it's been sitting too long on the grill. It's dryer and just not as tasty. That's why I try to time my visits right before the big lunch or dinner rush. There is a much better chance of getting the El Pollo Loco chicken you see in their advertisements.

For the most part, the wait staff is nice. Oftentimes robotic nice, but I've never had anyone treat me disrespectfully or act as if I'm doing them a favor by entering their restaurant. Generally, employees are all teenagers trying to do a good job and be pleasant to everyone. I have no complaints in this area.

I've been coming to El Pollo Loco for over fifteen years and usually eat here once or twice a week. Besides my three piece chicken combo, I've had most of their salads, burritos and tacos. Everything I've eaten was good. However, the three piece combo is still my favorite. I love to get a corn tortilla and stuff it with chicken, some beans, salsa and then take a big bite before the whole things falls apart. Yum! 

If you haven't had El Pollo Loco before, you are doing yourself a disservice. Go and order something. I can almost guarantee that you won't be disappointed!More",August 2016,El Pollo Loco

774stand,30.0,"Six months ago I would have given this EPL a TERRIBLE rating, but it has been remodeled and the staff seems freshly trained. Staff used to be unfriendly and manager was just a scowling menace. They also used to constantly run out of iced tea...forcing tea drinkers to go stand in front of the counter like a waif from Oliver hoping one of the inattentive counter people would get you some tea. The remodel seems to have improved things a bit, probably since this is a test location where EPL corporate tries out new store designs (or so the staff says). 

The restaurant indoors however remains an annoying echo chamber and in what seems like the standard for fast fooderies these days. It's frequently packed with spoiled, unattended Adderall-juiced ragamuffins running around shouting and screaming like it's the MacDonald's playland. Admittedly, the sub-par local parenting in not the restaurant's fault, but it more often that not makes the dining room uninhabitable for mannered adults. So go through the drive-thru and escape the sad reality of modern child-rearing. This EPL mostly gets the drive-thru orders right. Usually hot too.More",April 2016,El Pollo Loco

ArchieMYL,40.0,"My grandson and I spent the day at Knott's Berry Farm (See my review of the park) and decided to have lunch at Coasters. It is located in the Boardwalk area of the park. Coasters is basically a hamburger-hot dog-chicken strip type of restaurant, and...of course includes fries, onion rings, and shakes. It's a bit over priced but that is to be expected at a theme park restaurant. It wasn't outrageous and you do get a pretty decent meal. We ordered the jumbo hot dog plates with fries. I had a soda and my grandson had a chocolate shake. While the restaurant is fairly small we were lucky to score a both inside as it was hot and humid the day we went.

I have no complaints on the food, hence the four star rating. But the ordering process if rather frustrating. When you walk in the front doors, I think to simulate a dive-thru experience, you're greeted by a counter with two units to type in your orders yourself. It is of the touch screen variety. Once you place your order you proceed to the next counter where you pay. After that, you head down to the end to await your food. 

However, on this day only one of the units was working and the person at the other unit didn't have a clue how to proceed. She was getting help from a staff member but not understanding the process. After waiting about five minutes, with the line slowly growing, we were finally waved up to the ""pay"" counter to place our order the old fashion way: actually speaking to a human being. I guess I'm getting old but why do we feel technology is always our friend? Sometimes it just gums up the works. While we were eating, tech support showed up to fix the second unit which appeared to be up and running again as we were leaving. 

Overall, as stated previously the food was good and fresh. The ordering process does give me pause on whether to eat here again, but we'll see.More",July 2017,Coasters Diner at Knotts Berry Farms

My Red Miso Short Ribs were not warm at all and the Truffle Mac and Cheese was barely warm, the only thing that was hot was my Tomato soup. Food that is supposed to be served hot should never be served at room temperature, it is a health issue and also it is just not as satisfying.

Hank's is one of those great ""hole-in-the-wall"" restaurants with good, solid food and terrific friendly people. We...phoned in our order and then sent Dad (that's me) out to pick it up while the boys got the dinner table ready. We ordered carnitas, tacos, taquitos, and enchiladas and had way too much food. It was well prepared and well seasoned.

There was a constant stream of pickup orders and the line was never less than eight people. It's a popular place.

Parking is somewhat of a challenge as the restaurant is located in a small strip mall and shares a tight parking lot with a number of establishments. There are a few tables inside and along the side of the building although I wouldn't necessarily recommend eating outside as it fronts Baker Street which an be noisy and busy. Do take out.

Overall, I would definitely recommend this.More",October 2016,Hank's Mexican Food

Their specialty donuts are very creative.  There were so many incredible concoctions...to choose from at 10:30 am.  Perhaps there were still many choices because it was awful weather that Saturday.  

There is no indoor dining.  Go to one of their two windows, purchase what you want, and then you are finished.  One side displays all the basic donuts.  The other side displays all their specialty donuts.  Prices are reasonable especially when you compare their unique donuts to other gourmet donut shops.

I bought a combination of basic and specialty donuts for the family.  Everyone was pleased with the sweets.  Personally, I ate a Red Velvet cake donut, Nutella Banana Creme, and a Peanut Butter Jelly donut.  All were very good!!

With such a multitude of gourmet donuts, you better believe that I will be returning many times in the future!

This Subway has always had slightly subpar sandwiches. Everything is ""fresh enough"" but nothing ever seems to be what I expect from Subway. I typically order from them when I am slammed at work but need lunch because they deliver within an hour....It's food that arrives when I need it and the taste while not quite fantastic, is at least food. 

The last time I order, the pastrami was horrid. It was like chewing a half meat, half fat concoction that bore no pastrami taste at al. The fat was so thick and nasty that at one point, I looked down to see if there was a rubber band in my sandwich. That was the consistency of the fat on the meat. 

In the same order was a flatizza which is a part flatbread, part pizza. I ordered it with pepperoni and black olives. It arrived smelling like lighter fluid or a similar chemical. It was inedible, the taste was exactly how it smelled. I could not get the taste out of my mouth for an hour. I complained about the meal and they refunded the pizza, but not the sandwich.

We went in by chance, and by chance it was perfect.  The vibe was colorful, with surfer and skater stickers all over the place, like a little beach shacky, and they were playing Sublime.  It complemented our trip to Rainbow Sandals and our current mood perfectly. I got a grilled chicken burrito and it was huge and packed with amazingness!!  Great salsas, and super friendly staff!!

Luke17,30.0,"The best thing about The Empanada Maker is definitely it‚Äôs title. As for the empanadas, and the many many 5 Star reviews, I do not agree with the praises. Two dozen were purchased, at the tune of $25+ each for their original style group, which...are a little less expensive than the more gourmet?
Place is kind of big, but it looked like it was a little deserted for all the hoopla we had been led to believe, and fall for. We were passing through, so we purchase on faith alone, something along the lines of if so many people think they are great, what could possibly go wrong then?
First dozen: chicken, beef, spinach, ham and cheese. Dough was appropriate, not spectacular. Beef and chicken filling almost creamy, as if a food processor had been used to mix all the ingredients, sacrificing texture and pretty much all the aspects that makes an empanada a memorable bite. If their chicken and beef are part of the 5 Stars praises, then the ideal empanada surely would deserve 50 Stars? Spinach were definitely much better, perhaps for the fact that they require less ingredients. All the empanadas, must be said, had liberal amount of filling.
Ham and cheese were decent, service was all to ourselves as movement of people was minimal, which brought forth the question: since it has so many enthusiastic reviews, at what time exactly it begins to gather clientele? Go figure, for we arrived around 12:30 PM, and one other patron was already eating. Empanadas are served in pizza type boxes, which I thought was a nice touch, with proper advertisement in such a large surface. The second dozen included: four cheeses, more ham and cheese, spinach and beef. Not very innovative on our part, I concede, but we figure they were going to be so good, who cares? Decent enough to be edible, but please don‚Äôt be saying these are the bees knees, okey? Usually busy places indicate large number of happy customers. The chimichurri? was very oily, and somewhat usable, but one of the two given, was tossed away. If I want to overdose on oil, I will do it in the comfort of my home, with either olive oil or canola purchased at reliable Costco. Should mention that my beautiful companions said that the ladies bathroom was nice and clean, and that should count for something. 3 Stars.More",June 2018,The Empanada Maker

The americanized, spicy BBQ pulled pork empanada was just as yummy, and the heat indicator (6 out of 10) was spot on.

Ordered a double burger...with bacon, and the fried mushroom as a side. 
Burger was consistently good. Fresh crunchy salad leaves, tomato, well seasoned patties. It‚Äôs a clean and dry sort of burger and not your sloppy messy saucey, dripping type of burger. 
The fried mushrooms were out of the world great! Crunchy even for a takeaway meal, and it came accompanied with ranch dressing dips. Both items at a very reasonable $5 each, before tax. Just one word - Satisfying.More",August 2019,Apollo Burgers

While Blaze does not compare to East Coast pizza, it is still FANTASTIC!  Someone recommended this to me to try, which I...finally did.  Good move!  The pizza is personal size and plenty big.  Trust me, you get filled up.  You basically pick your sauce type (Red, Spicy Red, or white), then pick whatever toppings you want, and they throw it in high heat pizza oven to cook quickly.  Typically a pizza in a proper over can take as little as 2-3 minutes.  So the things in my mind that make a pizza good are the sauce, and the cooked dough.  I like a think crust, slightly crunchy pizza crust,  They nailed it here.  And the sauce is excellent!  I have tried other make your own cooked pizzas (Pizza Studio, Pieology), and find that Blaze cooks the crust longer, which is better, and the sauce is better.  The price is perfect....$9 with tax (roughly) for a pizza.  This is now a family favorite, as well as a few of my employees.  They love it!  Try it, you will not be disappointed.

Jim W,10.0,"I have been a Five Guys customer for the past some 15 years now.  But every year, the quality and food prep ... and service ... has been steadily deteriorating.  Case in point?  Today's simple order of a double burger, small fries and a strawberry/banana...shake that I had delivered.  What I received was a lukewarm soggy burger, the incorrect shake and no straw, and a meager serving of fries (absent the extra scoop you get in the bag.  

When I telephoned the store and spoke with Abraham, one of the managers, he initially tried to pin the entire blame for this order on Postmates, rather than address his food prep issues.  He tried to claim that the driver had eaten the bulk of the fries on his way to deliver my order.  He did finally acknowledge his own issues with the food. He tried calling Postmates and claims he was told by the person he spoke with that they would be happen to re-dispatch a driver to the store to pick up a replacement order.  But when I called Postmates to confirm, they told me  no, they could not do so and wondered aloud why the store manager would have said this.

The result of all of this is that I had to throw out the entire order because it was inedible.  I will never do business with this chain again ... EVER!  They need to get their act together, and provide the level and consistency of service they had in prior years.More",November 2019,Five Guys

victormena2,10.0,"Worst 5 Guys experience ever!  This is why In n out has nothing to fear.  First, the store had 70% of its tables needing a wipe down.  Next, the ketchup was empty, i asked the staff and their response was ‚Äúuse the packets.‚Äù  By the...way, there was plenty of staff to clean the tables and refill the ketchup.  Number of staff was not the issue.  I then received my order.  I had requested one burger to be packed to go with one of the fries to take home for our son.  That did not happen, despite the cashier‚Äôs previous insistence that it would.  I then opened my order and it was wrong.  I returned to the counter and the cook (with his gloves on) began to deconstruct the burger and assess the missing pieces.  Really?  What happened to making it right.  While eating my reconstructed burger, the next customer was pointing out his order was wrong!

W6633PYpauls,40.0,"We finally got around to stopping here for dinner. it wasn't our first choice but my boys were asking for burgers so we thought we'd give this place a try.

The interior is very retro, clean and well-maintained. The staff is friendly and helpful. The...burgers are a ""build your own"" setup where you've got a wide variety of additional items that can be put on your burger. The burgers are fixed price though so you may as well add a lot. I discovered that they have fresh jalapeno peppers and immediately added those to my bacon cheeseburger along with lettuce and raw onions. My elder son went with a bacon cheeseburger with lettuce, grilled onions and bbq sauce. My younger son just had the little cheeseburger - plain please. My wife got her cheeseburger with lettuce, grilled onions, and grilled mushrooms. We added some fries and drinks to go along with the burgers. Also, they have boxes of peanuts stacked out on the floor. They're complimentary appetizers - go help yourself. If you have peanut allergies, this is not a good restaurant.

For a family of four that worked out to $46. This is not an inexpensive burger place.

The food was good, though, and the fries were quite good. ""Good"" french fries are a pretty subjective thing though.

Parking is a joke. It sits in a large retail plaza anchored by a major chain store and parking is a challenge. Restrooms were clean.

Overall, while it was good, I'm not certain we'll be back. Try it once - see what you think (and get another review to your TripAdvisor account!).More",March 2017,Five Guys

I just moved to Laguna and love going out exploring and trying new places. Tried MANY over the last 2 months living...here ...Eating out at least once a day. This is for sure my new GO TO.

- Food is prepared fresh and very high quality
- Service is fast
- Very reasonably priced. Another favorite is Bear Flag Fish Tacos, but SO expensive compared. I think they could get away with charging more (Hope they don't see this)
- It's healthy and tastes BOMB. I am not typically a health food nut either.
- Portions are just right. They don't skimp and it's not overload either.
- Flavor is seasoned to perfection. There is so much flavor, but it's not overwhelming like other places that tend to drown their meats in sodium.
- Atmosphere is relaxed with outside seating or you can just take it at the to-go window.

I have friends that come down to hang out at a couple beaches here and they make it a tradition to stop at Taco Loco. I think that  tradition will change after I show them this place.

One thing to watch out for is the food can have a little bit of heat to it sometimes. Nothing unreasonable though.

On artisan bread and baked to a golden brown"". On each of the ingredients, you have the choice of none, light, and normal, and on the Premium Chicken, and Sliced Provolone, you have the choice of adding extra.

Next, I tried the Pasta Italian Sausage Marinara. Its menu description says: Penne pasta baked in a zesty tomato basil marinara sauce with Italian sausage, a blend of Italian seasonings and provolone cheese. You can choose not to have any Italian sausage or shredded provolone cheese.

My Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, as usual in restaurants these days, didn't look like the picture, as it had less than what the picture shows. But it still tasted delicious. When added with some of their Garlic Sauce Dip, it adds a nice touch to make it more tasty.

W6633PYpauls,20.0,"You'd think a place with ""Burgers"" in the name would have absolutely killer burgers. Sadly, this was more like one of the restaurants you see on ""Restaurant Impossible"": Outdated decor, seriously over-extended menu, and bland food. Here's what to expect:

Pros:
Staff is really nice....Great bunch of people
Parking was easy, location was good. If you're in one of hotels (Ayres or Travelodge), it's walking distance.
Decor is outdated but well maintained and the place is clean.
They have a small salad bar as well and self-serve drinks.

Cons:
Burgers were amazingly bland. ""Worst burger ever"" according to my younger son. He didn't finish it or his fries. For him, that's telling as burgers and fries are two of his three food groups (pizza being the third). Fries were tasteless and mushy. Onion rings used a batter similar to what's on corn dogs. Both tasted like pre-frozen materials.

Their menu is too extensive, ranging from breakfast meals, burgers, hot dogs, steak and chicken dinners, fish and chips, etc. It's probably too extensive and won't allow for any level of quality or consistency.

I can't really recommend this restaurant and it wasn't necessarily less expensive either: Burger combinations for four worked out to $42.More",October 2018,Bill's Burgers

Coover,40.0,"I looked at the exterior as I walked in .. it really looked good. The owner has done a good job making his restaurant look like a place i want to eat. I entered the restaurant to find exceptionally clean tables, clean floors, and a...clean order counter. I decided to use the Men's Restroom ... and what did I find? It was really clean and it even smelled good. Now I do not know if 5 minutes before I entered an employee cleaned the restroom, but this restroom smelled better than just about any public restroom I have ever been in. 

I ordered one of their hamburger Combo's and received it relatively fast. The hamburger had the usual things on it that most independent hamburger fast food restaurants place on them, the lettuce, the tomato, the sauce ... nothing special, but it was all fresh. The fries were good and plentiful. My only complaint ... the hamburger patty, itself, was cooked far too long, probably as a result of stories in the newspaper about restaurants serving under-cooked hamburgers and people getting sick from them. 

But overall, my experience at Bill's was very good, and if I am in the area, I would not hesitate to stop there for a quick meal. They certainly do try to make your experience a good one.More",October 2017,Bill's Burgers

This p***es me off every time I see it.  Not only is it stupid, it's also insulting.  I'm supposed to pay an extra 5% on my $14.00 order just for the privilege of eating Mexican fast food?  I don't think so.

The other thing that p***es me off is that these dumb b*****ds have actually turned their credit card machine into a profit center.  They're not just covering their costs but in a week with maybe 100 credit transactions per day, they're making an extra $200-300 per week on the backs of their customers.

Now, restaurants work on a food cost of about 20% so on my $14 transaction, their cost is around $3.00 so why would they make people think about only coming in when they have cash?
