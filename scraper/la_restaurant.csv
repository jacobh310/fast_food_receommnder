I can really only eat one burger and it is filling.  We had a friend of the same age whose older brother worked as a salesman for a company who made Chile.

It seems that his did not slide off the spoon as well as the one they had and needed it easily to slide off the spoon.  The Chile is what this burger is all about. I always ask for extra!

Station 2 is your choice of crab meat, avocado, onion and cucumber. If you're new at this just add everything you're into.
Station 3 is your ""nemo"" which is tuna, salmon, octopus, shrimp, scallops and others. 
Station 4 is the sauces , you can go very low spicy to dynamite ! And last but not least, top it off with masago, green onion, seaweed, ginger, wasabi and sesame seeds.

fearjac,50.0,"We researched our trip to where we were going to hit for food and sightseeing. My son chose this as he had his first taste of a poke bowl a few months ago and still raved about it. A good choice as my online search...confirmed this was one of the top 10 poke places in the L.A. area. So on our family vacation last week, we hit this eatery located in a nicely shaded mall on Hollywood Blvd with sweeping awnings. Eating outside on a shaded patio can't be beat. Simple setup.....you choose your bowl size and that will determine the number of protein you get then you pile on the toppings.We went for broke and ordered larges.

The kids made their own with tuna, salmon, seared tuna and white rice. They picked most of the fixings less the spicy garnishes. My wife and I had a brown rice version with yellowtale, tuna, salmon and shrimp plus a mild sauce. They mix it up for you and out comes your colourful and Instagram-worthy photo opp. 

We dug in. Perfectly marinated and not overly sweet or salty. The freshness of the seafood really were the highlight. Some peple say poke bowls are a deconstructed sushi rolls and some do taste that way. This did not. If you never had a poke dish - give it a go. Perfect food for a hot day (that's why they are so popular here). 

Highly recommended and the prices are not too bad either.More",August 2019,Pokinometry

As soon and we arrived we made it a point...to locate the closest Leo's Taco truck and we found this location on La Brea Ave. It was easy spotting the yellow truck and a line of people near a busy intersection and a gas station. There wasn't much parking near the location so we ended up parking at a shopping plaza around the corner and walked over. Once we arrived at the truck I quickly glanced at the menu but I already knew from my previous research which tacos I wanted. I wasted no time and ordered the Al pastor (pork of the spit), chicken, braised pork and a soda. My boyfriend ordered two tacos and a soda. The total came to a little over $9. We paid and waited for our number to be called. A few minutes later our tacos were ready and smelled divine. I quickly consumed the al pastor which seems to be their signature taco and it was amazing! The meat was flavorful and tender. And in no time we devoured all our tacos and were beyond satisfied. I now see what all the hype is about. The prices are too good to be true and the tacos are amazing. Definitely a must try in LA!More",August 2018,Leo's Taco Truck Inc

Hussainr,40.0,"Looking for a vegetarian option is tricky to say the least, but walked into Blaze pizza and found that the options were there for 'the making'

We opted for 4 vegetarian build your own. The chaps preparing the pizzas were very helpful. Firstly they both...changed their gloves so as not to contaminate the pizza with any meats. The first chap prepared the base asking us about sauces and cheeses and then passing over to the second chap who topped the pizza with what ever topping you asked for.

After the pizzas were baked in a stone bake oven the young lady carefully prepared the pizza with the green marked pizza cutter and tongs. 

I mean what can I say everyone was to helpful really made the experience a joy not to forget that the pizzas tasted amazing. Light crispy base just the right amount of sauce and toppings that you could actually taste. 

Oh! Forgot to mention the drinks. Ignoring the standard soft drinks they served juice drinks in a variety of flavours - Classic Lemonade truly hit the thirst spot. 

Price wise what can I say other than if you are in the Studios on a tour head out to the walk it's far more relaxing and enjoyable than the chaotic queues of the food courts inside and oh a greater food selection. 

There's always a honest point to mention and that is the queue does build up quickly  so you have to understand that this not so fast food. The team do a great job in getting the pizza that you want and then it needs to be baked.More",April 2019,Blaze Pizza

pinintheatlas,30.0,"We've walked passed Lucky Boy on Walnut St several times. It is always packed and seems to be exceptionally popular with the Pasadena Police. That's always a good sign of good food!. This Saturday we decided to give it a try. There was a small...line beginning to form and only a few tables left when we arrived. The food smelled amazing and the whole place was spotlessly clean. The spicy breakfast burrito was huge. I had the normal breakfast burrito without the tortilla.  They piled the scrambled eggs, hash browns and bacon high on the plate. Service was prompt. Servings were enormous, and the food was OK. I wouldn't say amazing but I didn't need a hot sauce to make it taste of something. One thing we were both very pleased about was the coffee. Normally this gets overlooked or maybe isn't the best at some cafes. We struggle to find good coffee so this was wonderful for us and we topped up on our way out.  For a quick hearty breakfast, this was fine. There are veggie options but no vegan. There is another location off Arroyo Parkway, that a lovely couple told us about, so we will go there one day.

I was not prepared for how incredible it was! HUGE! It could feed two. Delicious!

Dean W,30.0,"Being from Minnesota, we do not get to experience the In-N-Out Burger. We have heard about it for years, so when we finally vacationed in California we decided to give it a try. Upon arriving at the restaurant, the drive-through line was out the parking...lot and down the street. We entered the restaurant and it was quite busy. The dining area was limited with about 10 tables, with more picnic tables outside. I was surprised by the Limited menu (hamburger, cheeseburger, double burger), although I've heard rumors they also have a secret menu. I ordered a hamburger with fries and a strawberry shake, my daughter ordered a cheeseburger with fries and a chocolate shake. We thought the Burgers and Fries were average, the milkshakes were delicious. After hearing about the In-N-Out Burger for years, I was expecting so much more. If I was hungry I would try it again, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it. There are better options. I'm probably in a small minority when I say ""I preferred the Jack in the Box"".More",October 2018,In-N-Out Burger

GuidoKarp,10.0,"I always loved their burgers. However, I do also feel they have a responsibility to their neighbourhood​. Sadly, some of their customers seriously pollute the streets by just throwing their leftovers​ out of the car windows.​ I do understand and appreciate that this not the...chains fault - however, to me it sort of comes with the business to clean up. At least in the immediate neighbourhood​.

After watching things getting worse on my #tenthousandstepsperday walk, I reached out to their president, Lynsie Snyder, offering to organize some homeless helping me pick​ up and get them some food vouchers in return. I did not want to get paid for this - I just offered to help. That was in May.

Lynsie delegated to friendly Marice Caruso, who responded with ""....Thank you, too, for your proposal to manage litter in the vicinity of our Glendale (Holly Drive) location.  We have always been committed to making a positive contribution to our communities.  As such, we were disheartened by the picture you attached and we share your concern.

We are sorry, however, that we are unable to take advantage of your offer.  We would be uncomfortable passing on our responsibility to take good care of the communities in which we do business.  Instead, we would rather work toward consistently fulfilling this responsibility, and will start by ensuring our Glendale Team is aware of the problem and that they are vigilant in their efforts to clear the immediate area of litter.  We will also continue to identify and evaluate other possible solutions.....""

Leslie W,30.0,"I was intrigued by Yuca's homey backstory, and struck by the simplicity of their menu, so we thought we'd try this since it was nearby.  It's a very small stand on Hillhurst, and at lunch there was a steady stream of customers, most of whom,...like us, ordered our food to go given the scarceness of seating.  The menu is simple--a variety of burritos, tacos, tortas, option side orders of pinto beans--but for me the main draw was machaca, which brought back memories of living in northern Mexico.  I was, in a word, disappointed; indeed, I couldn't really tell much difference between my taco de machaca and my taco de carnitas.  My spouse's machaca burrito didn't win any rave reviews.  All was very lightly spiced--they add their own salsa, and aside from bottled salsas there are no options to spice things up (and as our order was wrapped and bag, not really much opportunity for us to add additional hot sauce).  The service was efficient and friendly, and orders were taken (and conversation had) in both English and Spanish, which was great.  The clientele seems pretty much a neighborhood one.  Not sure if I'll go back but it was worth trying.More",May 2019,Yuca's Hut

Try some Red El yucateco sauce: few drops at a time. Don't try to be a hero.

Love, love, love this place.  Just writing this review makes me hungry.  Located in Koreatown, although there is a little street parking, easier to get to w/ public transportation and walking.  Small place and...you will notice out front a sign of where to stand if the place is full.  I went for dinner before a show and was able to walk right in.  There is counter as well as table seating.  

I ordered (had seen the menu before - it is pretty simple w/ a few choices), paid at the register and grabbed a counter seat.  Prices were reasonable.  The guys and ladies were buzzing around the grill - all doing different things but staying out of each other's way while seemingly having a good time.  All the staff was friendly and while I was there, asking if I needed anything.  One of the guys saw my music t-shirt and we started talking music while he was working.  Turned me on to the Dead Sara band (check them out - super fun band) - he plays drums for this band.  

Soon enough my food came.  I ordered a single burger, lemonade and tater tots along with dipping sauces - I ended up getting 3 extra sauces (you get one free and then $1 each for extras) so I could try a few different ones - loved the habanero and ranch sauces.  Food seriously so good - think next time I will try one of the shakes.  I did not realize the lemonade was sparkling so didn't like this so much but it worked.  The burger was a delicious, messy (in a good way) creation with grilled onions, cheese, etc.  And the tots - like I said you could share but why?

I ended up eating half of the meal - saved the other half for the train ride the next day.  Plant based goodness for all the right reasons here.

Shanelle S,40.0,"Fast food roast beef sandwiches and frozen custard. Came here for dinner before catching a show at the El Rey with the sis around 8:30, and there was still a short line. There’s outdoor and indoor seating, and you can order all your food either...inside or outside (ignore the sign that says to only order fries and sandwiches that’s above the outside window). Parking is available in their private lot, but it’s small and spaces are pretty tight. 
The food was tasty, albeit smaller than expected. The beef and cheese sandwich was filling, and I especially enjoyed the spongey buns. The beef was tender enough, and I don’t want to know what’s in the cheese whiz, but it was good. The dirty fries came in a curly cut, and had sweet, caramelized onions, beef chunks, and gravy on top. We got a concrete to top off the meal, and the food came within 5 minutes. They have water cups and a fountain drink dispenser inside. For your knowledge, a concrete has all the ingredients mixed in while the sundae only has them in top. They have standard combinations or you can mix your own, up to 4. Unfortunately they were out of hot fudge and don’t have a coffee flavor, but it was still good. It wasn’t as thick as I thought it would be, but there’s no emulsifiers or preservatives so it does taste homemade. The brownies we added in were really chewy and sweet, and we also tossed in graham crackers and Oreos into a vanilla concrete. Didn’t see any bathrooms, there’s no free WiFi, they do take credit card, and you can order to-go or eat-in and they’ll call your name on the intercom system.More",February 2020,Top Round Roast Beef

cgirod,50.0,"I really really really like their roast beef. It's tender and melty and delicious. But it turns out the chicken is also quite good. The OG chicken sandwich is the best. It's like an original Chick Fil A sandwich, only much better. You get a...hunk of fried chicken breast, a little handful of pickles, and mayonnaise on a bun. Simple and perfect. They soak the chicken in buttermilk and pickle juice before it's cooked. There is plenty of acid to tenderize the chicken, and it's pretty wonderful. Highly recommend.More",November 2017,Top Round Roast Beef

I came with my husband and we had a hard time deciding which sandwich to get because they all sounded so good. We...ended up getting the Horse and Hole and their special which was a beefy melt. We split the sandwiches in half and shared. They had plenty of meat on them and the flavor was awesome. The horse and hole has a lot (like a lot) of horseradish on it but it's delicious. They have a round sauce which we ate with our curly fries and we also got a side of their homemade cheese whiz to dip the fries in which was delicious. I would come back to this restaurant any time.

The place was packed with teenagers, strange looking older men in suits (wearing medallions) and pot-heads stinking up the place. The parking lot had a very strong smell of pot (and Hey,...I've done it before, I get it.)
They did have a security at the location and we saw him chase the same girl out of the restroom tres veces! When I went into the restroom with my nephews (ages 6 and 4) the girl was washing her hair in the sink and yes, I did stare o_0 The security also chased out people sleeping at the tables.
At one point my 6-year-old nephew was questioning where all these kids' parents were (so cute) and why they were all out so late. I explained to the best of my knowledge that THIS was hanging out and having a good time and when he is older he would understand, which he nervously accepted. They could've all probably been college students and this In-N-Out along with the pot-smell kept them all looking young, aclamaciones! The young girls were all in barely-there clothes freezing and trying to huddle together, which was very entertaining, I do thank them for that :)

Dterry182,40.0,"Let's get one thing straight, In-N-Out Burgers are up there with the best burgers you can get from the major fast food chains. However, like every other one, they can't make fries like Macky Dees.
You give me an In-N-Out Burger and Macky Dees fries...and that's me done. 

My burger there today (Double, Double, what else!!??!!) was a taste sensation. Absolutely flawless. However the tasteless, cold fries were a real let down. 

I do like the nice touch of the pickled chillies by the ketchup pumps, others should offer this. If they had extra pickled gherkins, I'd be inclined to forgive them for the cold fries. 

So my advise. Find an In-N-Out Burger joint that's next to or close by to a Macky Dees, grab a Double Double (don't pussy foot about with the regular burger), some pickled chillies and then head to Macky Dees for a large portion of fries, and prepare yourself for fast food heaven.

Factual,50.0,"5 stars because it was even more delicious than I expected at a non-chain Mexican eatery, cheaper than I expected (I thought food would be overpriced at this touristy location, but perhaps most of their customers, most days, are regular locals), and I value small...servings at small prices.

My carnitas (chopped pork) taco had roughly 1 cup of meat on two small soft flour tortillas. That's roughly 3 times more protein than a Baja Fresh (fast food chain) fish taco. I said yes to cilantro and onion, and chose mild salsa, which was green. My taco was full of good taste, only $3.50, and enough for a light lunch, as filling as 2 Baja Fresh fish tacos and much tastier.

To order at the counter, instead of pointing at mystery chopped meats steaming in bins behind the glass, I asked for pork, because I didn't want to end up with beef cheek and pork stomach, like my husband, who was eager to try something new and adventurous. The beef cheek and pork stomach tasted O.K. but were very fatty, with grease pooling on the tortilla and soaking into it.

Other meats listed on the menu included beef tongue and other unusual cuts, and chicken and other usual offerings. Standard options such as burritos etc. were available.

Even though the high temperature on that day was around 84 deg F (~28 deg C), sitting two tables away from the street's sidewalk was close enough to the opening to the outside to be comfortably cool, yet far enough from the street to be un-dusty with unoffensive car traffic noise.

I hope to try a different taco some other time!More",April 2017,Ana Maria

Hamburgers of all varieties, hot dogs also, but their signature sandwich is their pastrami dip and for good reason. Everyone knows they had and that is for...good reason also.

Order Fries and you will get double what you can possibly eat. Or, 

Order them with chili, or with cheese, or with both.

Add a pile of pastrami to those fries, OMG

The food does not disappoint and I have driven from one end of Los Angeles County to the other for a cheeseburger from The Hat. 

The best item on the menu are the ""wet"" (gravy) fries.  They are an institutional icon.  An absolute must.

If you are unfamiliar with the Apple Pan, they only have a ""U"" shaped counter with maybe 24 stools. No tables, booths, etc.  We showed up...with about 8 people standing against the front wall. Sign on the wall says ""1st come, 1st served"". OK, I get it - we'll wait. After a few minutes a couple left and the couple standing at the left end of the wall took their place. I though, ""Ok, that the system."" Soon afterwards another couple arrived and took their place to the other side of us. Next, a lady comes in and takes a place on the other side of those people. About 5 minutes passed before anyone else finished their lunch. When the next two seats were vacated, this ""lady"", who came in well after we did, just sauntered over right passed us and the others waiting, and sat her ass down. I could not believe it!

The Apple Pan is an institution and transports one back in time. They have two types of burger, the Hickory & Steak, each with their unique...fresh sauce. You can order double patties with extra pickles or cheese but I would suggest try the original one first. The bun is spongy,  but not to sweet. The lettuce & pickles very fresh, the Pattie is thin and reminiscent of a burger as it was intended to be. 

They make fresh pies on site, the apple , banana cream and pecan being the most popular. Seasonal pies also make appearances on the menu every so often.

Well I was disappointed when my order came. The  burgers were way smaller and thinner, no large slice of onion or tomato. The fries were okay but not large and crunchy like I remember. I was in my 30's when I would go to this place in the bay area. So much has changed, no more mom & pop feel. Feels like Mac D's or other big burger places. Where the food is processed and not fresh. Too bad gosh, this was total let down for me. It's too bad that kids today will know In-N-Out burger like this, large and processed.

Be sure to try the chimichurri. I mixed the spicy with the original chimichurri and it was so tasty with just a hint of heat in the back of my throat. Added a nice extra flavor. Awesome! My wife got a nutella Oreo concoction she really liked. I'm a savory person, she loves the sweets!
At $3.95 each, they seem pricey until you eat them! Took them home and heated them wrapped in foil, left slightly open, in the toaster oven. Perfection!! Each one was a meal for me. Those empenadas are stuffed full.

You can also make it a combo, which comes with beans, rice, and salad.  The staff are so kind, they give out good portions and good recommendations, and the prices are reasonable.

MM590,50.0,"Short story: 
Stop by between early lunch and late night. Order tacos. Eat at the outdoor tables or take away. Be delighted with your wise life choice.

Longer story:
Across the street from the local high school, Taco Azteca serves up fresh and authentic taco...goodness. I stopped by twice during a recent stay in Glendale (once at lunch and once at dinner) trying most of the taco options. 

This is not an indoor, sit down place. Rather, walk up to the window to order your food and wait at the handful of covered tables or the stand-up ledge. While the staff prepares your tacos, nosh on hot peppers and cucumbers -- and hopefully the Tamarindo or Horchata you ordered (both = delicious!). 

There wasn't a bad taco on the menu. They are street-taco sized (smaller), so you can order several without guilt. It was a close call, and the fish taco came out on top. It is about twice the size of the other tacos and piled high with accoutrements. You have verde and roja salsa options, both fresh. The roja has quick a kick to it.

This place keeps it simple and does it right. They take a couple kinds of cards and, of course, cash. Enjoy!More",March 2017,Taco Azteca

The idea is to put raw ingredients (carbs and veggies) in a bowl, choose two proteins and a sauce. Spicey soy is highly recommended....You then give the bowl to the cashier and they will cook your food in a spinning pot. Very cool!

Food is delicious (after all - you’re the one choosing the recipe) and the price is very affordable in comparison to all other restaurants on Hollywood Boulevard.

Trail802695,50.0,"Was here in January 2019 and came to Hollywood/Highland Center @ Dolby again in Mar/April 2019.   I had enjoyed it so much at the beginning of the year, that I came back again.  It's still fantastic.  First, hand sanitizer readily available at the beginning.  Each...person grabs their own tray, and their own bowl (all one size).  Next start filling the bowl to your heart's content at the various ingredient bars.
First stop:  Noodle Bar:  Egg noodles, udon, spaghetti, rice noodles or any combination of noodles, but save room in your bowl for the veggies.
Second stop:  Veggie Bar:  Fresh broccoli florets, sliced carrots, zucchini, bell peppers, onions, tiny corn, kale, cabbage, mushrooms, scallions, jalapeños, etc.  Top off your bowl here.
Third stop:  Protein Bar:  Two containers are included in the price (which is currently $11.50), but you can always take more protein containers and just pay extra for them.  I always take double chicken, but you can mix and match. The choices were chicken, beef, sausage, bacon, meatballs, shrimp, scallops, pork, tofu, I believe.
Fourth stop:  Sauce Bar:  I like the Teriyaki, but there is a Volcano, Garlic Curry, Fusion BBQ, Spicy Soy, and Sweet Spicy.  You can mix and match.  Some are gluten-free, too.
Next stop:  Pay for your tray/bowl.  Anyway, all day pricing is $11.50.
They pour your bowl of ingredients into a spinning wok, along with your proteins and your sauce.  Spinning woks are washed between person's order which will make gluten-sensitive people happy. I never timed it, but maybe the spinning wok takes 5 min. or less (?).  There are maybe 8-10 woks that can spin/are spinning at one time.
Sooo good. A piping-hot dinner for $11.50 in Hollywood is pretty incredible. 
Anyway, lots of forks, chopsticks, napkins are available and you can eat in or take out.  If eating in, you'll probably want to add a beverage or have water.  It's a very clean dining room.
I take out, so I usually skip the beverage.  

It sounds like it's a long process, but it takes me only about a minute to load my bowl with veggies, place 2 proteins on my tray, and a sauce container and to then pay and then my food is spinning away in the automated spinning wok.
Note:  I should say that if you don't want noodles, you can just do veggies and they offer white or brown rice on request.  

The ingredient bars are clean and well maintained and people who work there are ALL so nice and friendly.  

Love this place!More",April 2019,Whealthy

Thea F,50.0,"If you judge Zankou Chicken by the appearance of this location, you will most likely assume that you’re dealing with some unexciting cheap fast food. While the food is inexpensive, it is also absolutely delicious. 

The falafel are my favorite in LA - huge, crispy,...perfectly seasoned, and gluten free (both in terms of ingredients and because they’re not made in a shared fryer with gluten-containing foods). If you’re like me and are gluten intolerant, you can get a falafel plate without pita - just say that you’re “allergic” to wheat and need the kitchen staff to change to fresh gloves before making your salad (they handle the pitas and can cross contaminate your salad otherwise). Even without pita, you get a very filling meal for under $10!

The hummus that comes with the falafel plate is creamy and thick, and you get plenty of delicious pickled turnips. Don’t forget to ask for garlic sauce (vegan and gf). If you’re really hungry, try a cabbage salad or some sarna (like dolmas), or some muttabal (like baba gahnoush). The menu is small, but full of delicious options.

My friends also tell me that their tarna and shawarma are some of the best that they’ve ever had. I’m recommending Zankou for diners on a budget who don’t want to compromise on flavor, quality, and freshness.More",January 2018,Zankou Chicken

Richard J,50.0,"I get so tired of having meals for lunch when I am on the road.  Sometimes I just want to go to a sandwich shop instead. A colleague mentioned this place and since he was a local, I figured it would be okay.

Not sure...where I would have parked. It was only a block away, so I walked. Easy to find. The hostess was right inside the doorway, smiled and gave me a friendly greeting.  Made me feel like she really WAS the hostess. She made a small joke, and we both laughed. Good beginning!

You order, you sit down, and they bring your sandwich to you. My colleague recommended a hoagie, but I really wanted a Philly cheese steak.  Oh I know I shouldn't have, but what the heck? Surely I can have one a year!

But I would have a whole lot more if I could get them from Boos. Gosh the sandwich was juicy, hot and delicious. One of those sandwiches that, when you've eaten it all, you feel kind of sad that it is done.

The place was clean and neat.  Service was good. It had some foot traffic but I think there was no waiting for seats. The other customers were friendly and clearly happy to be there.

Friendly staff (I had no idea what to order, so was totally guided by them) suggested a half and half of two different cheeses, the difference between Mexican and American Pepsi was explained patiently (you learn something new everyday) and the smell whilst waiting was to die for!

Not exactly a ‘fine dining’ interior (which loses it a mark), but honest and relaxing - based on one take out order I saw filling 4 massive bags, I’m not the only person who enjoyed eating there!

Dave's menu is fairly simple, with bold Nashville flavors. There is varying heat levels I chose hot and my significant other chose mild. Pleased be advised that hot was hot! It had a bold kick that absolutely hits you in the face, and that is 3 levels down from their hottest. Caution advised.

muazzams2017,50.0,"This place needs no further accolades as most of the reviewers agree that the food is amazing. Here's a trick to the parking woes. Go across the street and park in the free parking lot of Smart and Final. 
Coming back to the food.... there's...always a line. On the average you will be waiting 45 to 50 minutes in line even before ordering food, during busy hour. That many hungry people can't be wrong. I love their sliders and tenders. Fries have this spicy powder sprinkled on it that makes them even better. Kale slaw is also very good. Chicken is juicy as it is marinated in their secret brine solution before they fry it. I usually order medium or hot, however I have tried extra hot as well. I wouldn't recommend the reaper unless you are a certified chili conquering humanoid. To avoid long wait times, go between 3:30 and 4:30 p.m.....

I even hesitate to put it in the same category as a “fast food” because the quality is so much better.  It could be served in a better dining venue and past the test.

Shanelle S,50.0,"Popular spot that was formerly a good truck, now turned into a brick and mortar store. The hot chicken was just like what you’d get in Nashville and perfectly juicy and well-seasoned. I loved the seasoning. They only do either chicken tenders or sliders, but...they do them extremely well. You can get a combo of 2 tenders plus crinkle cut fries (which were also well-seasoned) for ~$11 and add an extra tender for ~$3 more. For a party of four, I would suggest getting 3 combo #1s and adding an extra tender to all 3 rather than getting 4 combos because the tenders are quite sizeable. You have the option of country, mild, medium, hot, extra hot, and reaper. I went with medium and I found it to be great. The hot was spicy and I found myself grabbing for the white bread that came in the platters. Only the hot one came with pickles. We went at around 4:30 and waited in line for about 20 minutes. You pay before you get your food (they call out your number or you can get takeout) and it was about 15 minutes for the food to come out. They do take credit card and since we checked in on yelp, we got a free soda. The soda dispenser was around the corner and they have water cups available too. We were able to snag a table relatively easily and there’s counter seating if you’re dining solo. Just be sure to keep an eye out and maybe have someone claim a table while you’re in line. There are restrooms available but the parking situation is tough. There is a lot but it’s always full - find street parking in one of the neighborhoods behind the complex instead, although know it is a bit of a rough neighborhood. Overall highly recommend coming here if you like chicken tenders or spicy things in general.More",August 2019,Dave's Hot Chicken

sincerelywhit,50.0,"Pro Tip: order your food online for takeout at least an hour before you’d actually like to eat because the wait is always long.

Jr Burger w/ cheese: meaty well dressed & seasoned burger. The cheese tastes like the “cheese” that comes with clear wrapper...around it but it works. This burger tasted like my mom & dad cooked it, real nostalgic super delicious.

Chicken wings dinner: again the chicken tastes like my parents or a family member made it. Comes with fries & dinner roll.

Chili cheese fries: delicious “homemade” tasting chili & cheese. I stuffed myself to eat more of these because it’s extremely rare that I find a tasty chili cheese fries.

Michele C,50.0,"Ok, so you are not impressed with the restaurant appearance.  And, you are doubtful you are in the right location.  Rest assured you are going to enjoy the best burger ever!  Black Angus fresh burgers and fries.  I had the Jr. Burger with small fries...and it was perfect.  You can go for the gusto and get the big burger.  Outside seating only or take out. Parking can be a hassle.  There is a small parking lot next to the restaurant or park along the side street next to the restaurant.   I promise you, this will be the best burger and fries experience ever!More",December 2019,Hawkins house of burgers
mike m,50.0,"Their featured burger, ""The Whipper"", which is two large patties of fresh, not frozen Black Angus beef, cheese, tomatoes, onions and lettuce, is without a doubt the best burger that I have ever eaten.  This burger costs about $13, which is a very good value,...as it is so enormous that I can split it with my wife, and still not be able to finish the burger!!!  It is enormous!!!

The downside of Hawkins is that it is about a 30 minute drive from mid-city Los Angeles, and it is in a very dangerous part of LA, in Watts.  It is located across the street from the biggest projects in Watts, and you will quite likely be in line with gang bangers and ex-convicts.  Having said that, I have been here two times, and had absolutely no problems.  Everyone was respectful of each other, and looking forward to, or enjoying this fine food.

If you are not intimidated by the location, then you'll probably enjoy one of the best burgers that you've ever eaten.More",June 2019,Hawkins house of burgers

The burger was hot; bun was lightly toasted, the beef patty was juicy and perfectly cooked and was topped with fresh lettuce, tomato and condiments (ketchup, mayonnaise and mustard). The burger was accompanied with hot, crispy steaks fries. Both burger and fries were generously sized; easily feeds two people (if one doesn’t want to overindulge).

We ordered the colossal with cheese, a double cheese with chili, and a bacon cheese burger.  We clearly didn't ""fit in"" the area, but the patrons were so friendly.  It was nice to see people interacting and just being neighborly.  I highly recommend this place.

The inside is just to order, small, no room to sit or anything. Outside they have some covered tables. Place may not seem like the cleanest place on Earth but no real issues. Service was pretty fast. Food was really good. Wasn't crazy about the pastrami. Next time I think I'd just go with regular cheeseburger. Fries weren't too great. But the burger itself was really good, it's really a big burger. Even my friend who just got a cheeseburger thought the same. Prices are pretty average: the burger, drink and fries came to like $13.

This ain’t momma’s Oscar Meyer weiner amigos.  I suspect folks generally eat these with their hands, but I quite couldn’t grasp that concept with this dog, so I dined with my plastic fork and knife to finish this one.  Extremely tasty.  Good season and general additions on this dog.  I would quite like to return and sample the other plant based offerings.  Service was extremely courteous and attentive, even though this is not an “order at your table” establishment.  Still, staff came out a couple of times to ask how things were going.  Whilst this was during a lunch during work hours, I didn’t sample the brews on taps, but at least noticed that not only were a good variety available, but they were in fact, a very good variety of brews.

And...for the occasional splurge, you Can. Not. Beat. It. The Hangover Burger is executed to perfection, and any of the hot-dog creations are glorious in their excess. Tots are better than fries, though both meet the minimum standard for yumminess.

JaDeGirL01,40.0,"My friends wanted to eat at Grand Central Market which I don’t usually have a problem with. My first choice of Eggslut was wrapped around the booth from the front, which meant that my friend had no intention of waiting in line with me. So...we started walking around. We hit up Roast To Go because she really wanted Mexican food. She ordered the taco plate for $13 which was loaded up in the best way possible. I opted for the Al Pastor burrito ($10) with everything and told the guy behind the counter to make it was spicy as possible. He nodded and started loading my burrito. He asked if I wanted it for here or to go. I initially said “here” but then asked for a box because it was massive in size. He also asked if I wanted it cut in half which was so nice of him because that’s exactly how I eat my burritos. I usually just eat half and save the rest for later. Well not this time because I was starving. It’s amazing what a little manual labor can do to your appetite. I ate about 90% of the massive burrito and was full until the following morning. It wasn’t spicy, but how was he to know that I wanted Howlin’ Rays level spicy? To be honest, this was a great alternative to waiting in line. There was no line at Roast To Go because they are efficient in serving up food since 1952. They may not be the most popular stand but they are good and at that moment, that’s all that mattered. They take credit cards and the service was great.More",March 2019,Roast To Go

I can tell you this burrito is not skimpy, the way she kept piling on the fixings on the tortilla I wondered how she's going to wrap it up.

The food is on display and kept warm, but they have a huge turnover, so you know for sure that the food is always fresh! You can find a table and eat inside of Grand Central Market, or take your food ""to go"". They do take credit cards, and there's parking available in the parking structure.

In N Out is awesome... Truly awesome.  There are a...few things to consider before venturing here though.  First, I walked here during the day.  I wouldn't walk here at night.  It is relatively close to areas I would have felt safe walking at night, but not the last .2 miles I walked.  Second, this place was packed.  I was alone and lucked upon a sole stool open, and relegated myself to eating on a dirty counter.  It's hard to blame this place too much as the place was packed.  Absolutely packed.  Third, there was a homeless man inside begging for food/money.  I understand that homelessness is an unfortunate part of reality, but I hate dealing with it inside of an establishment.  Overall though, the food is awesome.  The wait was about 15 minutes for food after ordering (again, the place was packed).  It definitely filled a void in my life, but I doubt I'd rush back to this location again.

Shanelle S,50.0,"Brick-and-mortar location of the original food truck. The hard shell shrimp tacos are the best in all of LA. There’s something so addicting about biting into that crispy shell into the delicious mix of shrimp, avocado, and salsa. Top it off with some lime and...a few dabs of the fiery red hot sauce, and you’ve got yourself a little bite of heaven. It’s $2.25 plus tax per taco (there’s no tax when you go to the food truck though) so it’s also easy on the wallet. I’d suggest getting 3-4 for a meal. 

There’a street parking in the front and there’s also a park down the block where you could hypothetically picnic at. There is a small parking lot although it was full when we were there. They take credit cards. There is seating although right now there’s no dine-in due to covid. 

You can’t go wrong eating the shrimp tacos here but they do offer other items like ceviche tostadas. If you can’t get to the food truck, then definitely come here to get your fix.More",June 2020,Mariscos Jalisco
Shanelle S,50.0,"This food truck has consistently been at the top of my list of places to try, and I’m so glad I finally got to eat here. They’re open during coronavirus and I got my food in less than 5 min. I had tried calling them...to place the order but they don’t actually start making the food until you get there and pay. Cash only but I got 6 shrimp tacos for $13.50 so just bring a 20 and you should be good. There was a little mix-up because my dad thought this was the truck for the other Mexican restaurant that’s on the same block (Mariscos 4 Vientos) but these restaurants aren’t affiliated. Parking is hard because it’s just street parking along Olympic. 

That being said, the food is totally worth it. The shrimp tacos in the hard shell are a work of art. We took them to-go and the tortilla was still crunchy and you can tell it was freshly made. They put in an avocado which you could scoop into the taco which complemented the crispiness  of the shell so well. The salsa was served separately and tasted amazing, and the hot sauce was just the right amount of spiciness and acidity. Writing this is making me hungry again - I will definitely be back again soon.More",May 2020,Mariscos Jalisco

therealserrini,50.0,"Fill Video Review at Cineclast

The 20th century birthed for us as civilization many a great innovative contribution. The advent of advanced medicines allow us to live longer, scientific mental explosions allow us to travel to far away planets to know more about us here...at home. Perhaps the greatest gift modern times have given us is combining the world's greatest food with the automotive industry, that is, the taco truck.

While it certainly cannot be argued that this is by far the greatest scientific advancement in our time on earth, people may argue as to which of the many taco trucks in Los Angeles is the “best”. While it is estimated that there are as many as 30,000 of these trucks slinging disks of delights in the greater LA area at any one time, there is only one that we can claim is the best. 

Just off the corner of Olympic and Dacotah (I guess a guy from Long Island tried to spell Dakota) in the Wyvernwood section of Downtown LA, you will find a simple white truck surrounded with bright red stools, and usually a happy crowd waiting for the best hand food this city has to offer. Dont be fooled; MJ truck has lots of delights to choose from, but they are known for one particular dish that is sure to delight, Tacos Dorado de Cameron, or, Golden Shrimp Tacos. 

The golden comes from the deep fried color of the lighter then air taco shell, or perhaps from the richness you feel as these savory morsels enter your mouth hole, either way they got the Midas touch when it comes to authentic and fantastic Mexican street food.

Grab yourself a wedge of fresh lime, a cold Mexican coke with real sugar, and a place in the shade to throw one of these huge tacos back, and I guarantee you will not be sorry.

But several bites later I began to realize that I couldn't really taste chicken, all I was tasting was the spice and by the time I finished I was turned off about the taste. So a week later I tried the regular sandwich and for some reason I was turned off. And I guess I'm not alone. When the place first opened it was so busy you couldn't even get in the parking lot, Now days, it always looks empty.More",June 2016,Chick-fil-A

Had the double cheeseburger w/ everything and Chili dog with onions, small fries. Wife had the grilled chicken sandwich.
Lots of lettuce and fixes on the burger almost covered the taste of burger. Huge chicken sandwich and the fries were the star!! Nicely fried and like steak fries.

Every time I visit Pasadena, I eat here DAILY. It’s that good. My most recent visit was on 9/23 AND 9/24 for the breakfast burrito, which is served all day. I took a friend with me and she loved it so much she wanted to go back the next day, which I was going to do regardless if she liked it or not. Lol

Lucky Boy is known for their pastrami, which is excellent. Their breakfast burrito is EVERYTHING!! They have a unique system to prepare food and you get your food fast. Depending on the time of day you go, there may be a line BUT it moves fast. The chili cheese pastrami fries or pastrami sandwich are huge and delicious. The portions of whatever you order are HUGE. All items on the menu are available all day. 

They only accept CASH but they have an ATM in the lobby. There’s seating indoors and outdoors. You place your order at the counter and they will call your number when your food is ready.

I feel a bit guilty giving The Hat three stars... but that's what I'm feeling.  Please read on...

This is an old fashioned burger place specializing in pastrami dips.  If you're...into some combo of hot dogs, pastrami, burgers, fries and chili... this is for you.  The staff was friendly.  For what it was, the place was clean.  The atmosphere is family friendly.  

The food was alright, but not great.  It didn't really leave me feeling to great either.  But that may have been in part due to the person sitting behind me who wouldn't stop bouncing their leg up and down which made me feel like I was on a roller coster.  So the seating isn't the most comfortable in the world and you feel everything the folks behind you do.  That said, there is more seating than there appears.  I was nervous we wouldn't get a seat, but that wasn't an issue. 

 Honestly, the coolest part of it was that nostalgic feeling of being in an old-school type place.  The neon sign is AMAZING.

We ordered the Burrito and a Southwest Burger for our main dishes. We weren’t expecting the portion size to be as enormous as it was, we had to save half for later. Seriously, Fala Bar is very generous.

The fat Burrito was packed to the brim with Spanish quinoa, black beans, a delicious crunchy taco mix, avocado, salsa, onion, cilantro and lime juice. This is easily enough for two people to share. 

Be sure to ask for Fala Bar's fresh Tahini sauce and a pot of hummus with your main course. There's also free water inside the shop (at Venice).

The Bacon Crispinator had lots of bacon, with the same hamburger patty as the classic.  It did not come with lettuce or tomato.  It was OK, not great.

DanielR84,50.0,This place has been around for some time now. But it’s new compared to other longer standing restaurants around the same area. The BBQ here is good but the BBQ sauce that makes it different from the usual is an acquired taste. It’s more of...a spicy vinegret and very watery. So if you like the sauces think and a little sweet this is not the place for you. But the rotisserie chicken is amazing. They have a great selection of sandwiches and salads and beers that change often. There is eat in and outdoor too so on a hot summer day or night this place is perfect. Located in the city of Eagle Rock in the county of Los Angeles it’s one of those places that delights. Parking is a good size but it gets filled quickly because everyone wants to drive in LA.

elizabethlascheid,20.0,"Whoever owns this franchise of Wendy's should be ashamed of themselves. It is dirty, understaffed, uncared for, and the food is bad. 

This is a small Wendy's on Vermont Ave. in a not so great area, but that is no excuse for unsanitary conditions and...bad food. When you get to the parking lot, you will notice it is dirty. The area is just not taken care of. That should have been my first red flag to run. There is a security person at the door. I was not sure why until I noticed him throwing someone out who was being loud. I think the person was mentally ill. So, okay, I get it. Moving on.

We attempted to order and it took at least 4 tries for the person to get it right. Luckily you can see your order on the screen so I was able to keep telling him again and again that it was wrong. Now, he was very nice and was trying so I have no complaint here, clearly the staff is not trained. That is not their fault.

While waiting we head for the bathroom. It was disgusting. Paper on the floor, a cracked sink, it was just horrible. See the photos I posted. Again, this Wendy's is clearly understaffed, so I don't blame the staff, I blame the owner, who clearly thinks he can get away with such conditions.

We finally got our food and our burgers were broken in pieces. The fries were cold. None of it was good. We won't be back to this Wendy's ever. I suggest you avoid it.More",September 2019,Wendy's

BodhranBeater,30.0,"The burgers here are good.  Very good in fact. It's the other stuff that messes up the rating.

Firstly the ordering process is confusing, despite very good signage describing their burgers. Perhaps a plastic model of what an order looks like would be good.

The...fries are not string cut fries but are fatter circular chips, deep fried. So they are not crispy at all.

I ordered two burger combo, finished classic style. They were tasty although I'd prefer slimmer pickles.

Now the burgers are delivered in a box that is the equivalent to skinny jeans. Tricky to get the wee burgers out without causing them to de consruct.

Finally there is no place to pour your ketchup so you can dip your fries.

In this location there was a bad smell from the bathroom/ sewers / Coke machine. I pointed it out to the manager. 

They have a beer and wine license.

Mock Chicken and meat that seemed to strange to me. Served with rice and a bread. The garlic Naan was freshly made but I thought a bit too thick and bready for me. the Samosa's were good.

My favorite dish is the cream and cashew curry chicken – absolutely delicious! Another standby my husband and I like to order as a side or a small bite is the samosa chaat with an extra samosa thrown in. I have not yet been to the Santa Monica location, but the one in east Culver feels has a pleasant atmosphere with ample seating and a small patio while the one in West Culver is attached to an Indian grocery store and has a real laid-back, local vibe.

Fred G,40.0,"Located in the same shopping center as the Pacific Winnetka 21 movie theatres, the Habit offers semi fast food at very reasonable prices. For instance, their double cheese burger with fries and a drink is only $7-ish, and their single w. fries & drink is...$5-ish. They offer a nice variety of common burger themes, along with some non-beef alternatives for those who prefer to not eat cow. The way it works is that you place your order at the counter, and then try to find a table indoors or out on the patio. When your order is ready, your pager/blinker will go off (like in a big restaurant) so you can go up and retrieve it. Drinks are self-serve. Not sure if the burgers are fresh or frozen, but they do come out nice & juicy. The fries are standard frozen taters, not fresh cut. The burger patties are large; so you may not want to order a double unless you are very hungry. Unlike In N Out, these patties are hefty and filling! Overall, better than In/Out, but not quite as good as Five Guys. However, the menu at Habit has more variety.More",April 2014,The Habit Burger Grill

Hungry, with no alternatives nearby that we knew of, we ordered 2 of the breakfast specials for 2.99 with sausage as the meat. We were asked if we wanted to make it a combo, so we said yes. I paid the bill with a 20 and received back 7 dollars and some change. I asked the cashier what was included with the combo and he said, the soda. Puzzled, I walked to a table, then pulled out my cell and calculated the breakdown.

The 2 breakfast specials were 6.50 with tax. The 2 sodas that made the combo were 6.27 with tax, the full price of just a regular soda, so no discount for a combo.

I asked the clerk if they had it and he said no, so I was considering my second favorite and he offered me a sample!  I was awe struck at the quality of the chicken and the sauce.  I got a bowl as it was lunch and I was very happy.  They also had plain and garlic naan and I was pleased with it as well as it seemed to actually be naan from a clay oven as opposed to some warmed up bread.  They also offered samosas.

Easy ordering with lots of meat choices. I went for two tacos and a tamale.

The street tacos are the small type, so order more than one - that way, you'll get to enjoy different flavors....I had one chicharron and one (pork) carnitas. The meat was piled high on soft corn tortillas, ready to fold and eat. Well, ""folding"" didn't really happen, due to the stack of meat, onions, and cilantro. I got about 3 big bites each, then scooped up what fell onto the plate with my fork. So good! The mild (green) sauce is quite nice on top.

The pork tamale was a big, puffy pillow that I unwrapped carefully. The masa was flavorful and soft, and the meat inside was delicious.

GrantAlexander85,50.0,"Jacqueline was very helpful and professional and gave me some really good recommendations. The service was fast and the food was fresh and authentic. If you're looking for something healthy they'll guide you as to the options that are most in line with that. The...parking is not a problem, there are spots all over the place and neat Trader Joes & prices are reasonable. I got the chicken protein plate and it was very flavorful with some really good sauces. The grilled vegetables were also a nice addition. I recommend people come here for some tasty Mexican cuisine or a nice casual meal. I've heard the tazons are really good and plan on trying those next time. I can totally see why their motto “We don’t serve fast food. We serve fresh food as fast as we can.” hits home after trying them out. After all, you are able to see them actually making the fresh tortillas.

We finally...settled on what we considered a safe bet: a grilled chicken salad in a deep fried tortilla bowl. It was disappointing: Lots of beans, but very little grilled chicken.

I mean, they make sandwiches that...are obvious answers to late night cravings. So when I was poolside at my Hotel? And stumbled on the menu I paid the $60 price to have lunch delivered poolside so that I could get the Big Texas sandwich for my husband. Which is a sandwich made with BBQ Brisket, Chicken Tenders, Mozzarella sticks, and french fries. Alll on a giant Hero Bun. I was so impressed with my traditional Pastrami and my kid raved so hard about his burger that afer Universal studios yesterday, I had Uber drop us off there for dinner. The in person experience was 100 times better than the Delivery experience. 1st of all the whole staff felt like a family of Hot Italian New Yorkers. I'm not sure how exactly HR is working out their hiring? But they NAILED IT. 2nd of all, the entire side of the building is an open floor plan, so during dinner which we ate in we were privy to all the action on the strip. Plus it wasn't too hot! In house we had MORE food for less money. Because delivery added $2 PER ITEM before be got to the $2,99 delivery fee. (a partner company. NOT THEM.) So we had another Fat sandwich, (Hot Fat Chick) I had a traditional philly cheese steak (DELICIOUS) my son had a cheeseburger. (Loved) and we had a Loaded order of fries that was $10, 2 drinks and Chocolate Peanut butter milkshake. All that was just over $50. And there were a ton of regulars in there and I saw them working it out for $12 or less. And I watched all this plus the exciting Police apprehension of the attempted robbery of the Arco across the street while listening almost ENTIRELY to my favorite 90's Hip Hop. Is was the BEST. And I just kept thinking about how HAPPY I would have been to have a place like this to Land back in SF in the 90's when I was actually looking for a place like this at 2am!!

kimo213,50.0,"Gotta say, only stopped by for a quick taco before a show, but what a taco. I've heard a lot about this place, it's on a lot of Best of lists. Not fancy, definitely a joint. A few tables outside. Prices are good. I always...get a carnitas or al pastor taco when trying a new Mexican place, it's a good gauge of how they cook. I had an al pastor taco with avocado and it didn't disappoint. Perfectly marinated meat, super tender, and the avocado was a huge chunk, not some watered down guacamolito. Loved it, can't wait to go back. My friend had carne asada and thought it was the best she'd had at a taco stand. I've been told the fish tacos are the bomb, I'll get one for sure in the future. Also curious to try their carnitas, but I might have fallen into a familiar trap where the first thing I ate at a place is so good I end up ordering it every time. Chile Colorado @ El Chavo, cochinitas burrito @ Yuca Hut, and now it seems al pastor at Cactus Taqueria #1.More",June 2018,Cactus Mexican Food

Note to future visitors, inform them of what you don't want in your burrito because they will not ask and you will be stuck picking out chunks of onions.

This one, and I guess, the only one, is here in downtown and it is great. The donuts are always fresh and the service wonderful....Now if you go during peak times it can get very crowded with a line, but it moves fast. I suggest you try to avoid 11 pm at night.  You will be socially distanced and that is great. You order at the window and grab your donuts and off you go.

Many people love the super fancy donuts and I have tried them and see the appeal, but I like the classic donuts--I can eat more of those--the super fancy are rich---don't eat too many or a tummy ache you will get.

They also have great coffee and their croissants are fabulous. Try to the turkey jalapeno cheese croissant. It is a meal. Have a great time and wear a mask.More",July 2020,California Donuts

We got a mixture of classic donuts (coconut, old fashioned, Boston Cream, Doh!Nut) and Specialty Donuts (Marble, M&M, Horchata).  Every single donut was AMAZING.  I really, really liked this place.  The donuts were excellent quality and they were very fun.

rickpoet,40.0,"My family and I have been to Veggie Grill in Encino many times since they opened in 2013. It’s comforting as vegetarians to be able to walk in a restaurant and know we can order anything off the menu and, for the most part, it’s...pretty good. We’ve never seen the place crowded so it’s always a fairly quick situation to order at the counter and then receive your food shortly thereafter.

On this particular visit I had the Korean Street Tacos. I LOVE the Tres ‘Fish’ Tacos from the regular menu and, I don’t know about you, but it’s hard to stray away from your favorites when you’re at a restaurant, but I thought I’d give them a try. These definitely won’t land in the category of “my favorites”. Way too much of the “gochujang” sauce was included which made it difficult to enjoy the dish.

The Tres ‘Fish’ Tacos, however is a delightful dim on corn tortillas with veggie “fish” that gives me the honest to good sensation that I’m eating fish tacos.

My wife had the Beyond Meat Burger, kale style (ie on a bed of kale instead of a bun for you gluten-free folk out there.) You can order any of the burgers with the new “Beyond Burger” patty which has the look, texture, and almost the taste of actual ground beef. It’s pretty darned good when prepared properly and it’s definitely the patty you should go with if you get a “burger” here. (It’s gluten-free as well.)

Our 9 year old’s go to is the Chickin’ Nuggets (which are more like strips than nuggets) which he gets with fries (other side choices available) and a dessert (carrot cake or cookies.) He gets very excited when we tell him we’re going to Veggie Grill as he LOVES this meal. The chickin’ strips are pretty good. I’ve enjoyed similar faux-chicken at other places a little more but these aren’t bad at all.

I love that they have a seasonal menu which offers new things to try throughout the year and am generally excited that I can get a different, hearty vegetarian meal there every time we go. Sometimes we find the food is prepared with a little bit of a fast-food sensibility…not quite as flavored / seasoned the way it should be, or, like with the Street Tacos, too much of something, whereas some other similar casual vegetarian restaurants have a little more chef’s artistry in what they present and deliver…that having been said we’ll definitely be back.More",February 2018,Veggie Grill

RaymondL316,20.0,"As a vegan, I am perhaps their target customer, and have been a long time regular since they opened.  But, what used to be a several-times-a-week habit, dropped to once every other week, to once a month, and now even less often.  Why?  The stores...have just declined.  First, the food is less consistent.  Second, prices have risen while quality has dropped.  Third, the stores are starting to show their age (badly in places)--furnishings and equipment are not maintained.  Fourth, bathrooms are increasingly resembling those in a third world country, with cleanliness in the rest of the store not far behind.  Fifth, and perhaps most important, the taste just isn't there anymore, not at all like it used to be.  I LOVED VG--really LOVED it.  Now, I can barely bring myself to go.

Bostonsavatage,40.0,"While I'm not a vegan (or even a vegetarian), my sister was visiting and she is a vegan.  Years ago I had been to another Veggie Grill location and had good memories, so I took her here.  She was in HEAVEN!!!  She absolutely loved the...food!  So if you're vegan... this is the place!!!  The ambiance was pretty cool in here as well.  It just felt fresh.

Here is the thing... I LOVED IT!  I had the ""Beyond Beef Burger"" and it was out of this world!  I'll admit I wish I had more... I would easily have eaten 2... but the taste and flavor was amazing!  I couldn't believe it wasn't meat.  It's actually rather strange.  Even the ""cheese"" was fantastic.

The one place where they could improve is maybe the training of those taking your order.  They were nice for sure... but there was a lot of confusion.  She was confused taking my sister's order, but ultimately got it correctly.  I however ordered my son a kid's meal, and thought I was pretty straight ahead... I ordered the Mac and Cheese with Sweet Potato Fries as the side.  Simple enough right?  They brought us a burger with sweet potato fries, and when I corrected them they all seemed really confused and came back with the mac and cheese and said ""Okay, here you go... you can have both the mac and cheese and the sweet potato fries, but we didn't charge you for the mac and cheese because you ordered the fries"".  They just couldn't figure out that what I didn't order was THE BURGER.  It was confusing, but ultimately worked out.  So just try to be as clear as possible.

All that aside, I had a lovely meal and I think all vegans should make this a must visit destination... and I'm serious... non vegans too!  Don't be afraid... it's really good.More",September 2017,Veggie Grill

We ordered a Breakfast Burrito with Avocado and a Breakfast Sandwich. Both were freshly prepared and really tasty!

imrico,30.0,"And it was good! I would rank it higher had it not been for a couple of issues I had. Issue #1 is i felt a slice of pizza at almost 5 bucks was a bit ridiculous. They had a combo meal for 7 dollars...or so, a slice, a drink and garlic knots, which I tried to order, but was told ""We dont have that"" And im like, but the sign is right there, and you have pizza and knots and the drink all there. And he was like ""We dont use that..."" I looked at him amazed, wondering if they dont use it, why is it there? They could easily remove it from view, but dont?

That's why they get 3 ranked. The pizza crust is great, but the price and that service was bad.  Would love to try it from NY at a better price. I think 2.50-3 is fair.More",July 2018,Joe's Pizza on Hollywood

greglie,50.0,"I've never heard of pupusas before coming to DTLA, but did a little research on where to find the best eats in the huge Grand Central Market, and Sarita's came up on nearly every list.  

While each of the pupusas are about 6-7"" in diameter,...be sure to get two per person so you can taste all the different creations they have.  Revuelta is amazing, but even the Beans & Cheese is so good.  Cactus Leaf provides a fresh take too if you're not looking to have meat in every option. Grab a glass of horchata to wash it all down -- they have both Mexican-style and Salvadoran.

They have a little counter area built into their stall at Grand Central Market so you can sit and enjoy on the spot, but otherwise there's a few tables nearby so you're not searching all over the place to find a place to scarf down the amazing food.More",May 2019,Sarita's Pupuseria

There was no line up because it was late afternoon and the bean and cheese pupusa was worth the wait. It was steaming hot and came with a side of yummy slaw.

We asked someone in the...long line up and they suggested the Revuelta Pupusas which were pork , bean and cheese filled pupusas.

Ordered the recommended pupusas, chose the queso (cheese).  Took a while to make, made fresh from dough and a...glob of cheese mixture, was well worth the wait.  It was piping hot with cheese oozing from every bite, crispy on the outside, chewy and juicy on the inside.  Added dab of hot sauce, perfect.  Just a few bucks, well worth it.

vegaswithkids,30.0,"We ordered the mixed fruit crepe with ice cream and the smores crepe with ice cream and three bottles of water.  Total was $32 plus tip.  The mixed fruit crepe was barely filled with fruit and had nothing else except the ice cream (which is...separate).  Definitely needs a little powdered sugar or whipped cream or even a drizzle of honey.  The smores crepe was overfilled with chocolate sauce and definitely needed the ice cream to break through the unending chocolate.  Again ice cream was extra so it should come with some whipped cream or something.
With all the other dessert places in the CityWalk, I definitely wouldn't come here again.  The servers were nice but too busy planning what to do in their downtime instead of taking orders and such.More",August 2019,The Crepe Café

I ordered a sweet crepe with banana, blueberries and strawberries. The crepe had a generous portion of fruit with it and was tasty with the added whipped creme on top. 

We sat down and they brought it to us. The front counter woman was chatting constantly with another worker, not paying much attention to other customers.

The ingredients seemed high quality and were a welcome change from what was offered inside the park.  Prices were extremely reasonable.  There were plenty of sweet and savory crepes to choose from.  We needed savory but can imagine how delicious a sweet one would be.  I love how the savory crepe gives you what you need but without heavy and filling bread. The crepe is light and flavorful.

Jersian,40.0,"This place isn't fancy. It's not elegant, it's just a roadside burger joint that makes good  burgers. I tried the cheeseburger with mushroom sauce, and it was very tasty. Now, I'm wasn't going to compare it with a well known LA chain that is known...for going In-n-Out, but I kind of have to. Each time I visit LA, that restaurant is a must do location for at least one burger. The flavor is delicious and consistent.

While the Munch Box isn't as pretty as I-n-O, the menu offerings are more diverse, and different. My burger was very good, and I would surely order it again, if I was in the area.

Big lunch mob was gone, if there was any. A gal with too much chest exposure...took our order at window. Got a hickory burger and a double cheese burger, one fry, one drink. Hubby and I split the side orders. All tables were dirty outside. But yet four people inside working. One was taking orders, not busy. And one guy with tats was cooking. The other two kinda wandered around inside. Someone needed to run out and wipe down the tables, or at least offer wet wipes up front for customers to wipe down tables.

Burgers were not good. Chili sauce was nice, Hickory smoke on mine was nice. But bun wasn't toasted or warm. And the thin almost one sided piece of hamburger was pink...not cooked enough. Fries tasted of old cooking oil. After we finished I asked about using the restroom. NO...was the answer. I thought California had a law that all cafes had to have a restroom for customers. Even fast food. Maybe I am wrong, but after we ate there, it would be nice to wash my hands at least.

We ordered the Aloha plate with 2 meats from 8 choices (Katsu chicken and...Kalua pork). Plate came with 2 large scoops of rice and a generous serving of salad with a sweet and pungent salad dressing with black sesame seeds. Katsu chicken is a deep fried breaded chicken breast. Kalua pork is seasoned shredded pork. Terriyaki and Kalua sauce available. Had to wait 10-15 minutes for the Kalua pork.We preferred the terriyaki sauce and found the Kalua sauce a bit too spicy for our liking.

Recently went there to get a quick small lunch. It was easy ot order the...food at the counter.  Line moved quickly and the employee behind the counter was friendly and courteous. My daughter ordered the junior cheeseburger with french fries and a drink. She said that the burger was ok. Did not eat much of the fries. I ordered the chili cheese fries. Had not eaten this in ages and I thought that I would treat myself to something wonderfully yummy but not part of my standard diet plan. I received them warm with chili and cheese on top. Actually tasted OK. I did eat the serving, added some ketchup and washed it down with an ice tea/lemonade combo drink (Arnold Palmer).

Things started to go really sour about 3 hours later. I became incredibly nauseous all of a sudden with a headache and chills. Started when I was driving home after an appointment the same afternoon. Thought that maybe it was due to the heat. Unfortunately not so. As soon as I reached home, I vomited up all of the chili cheese fries into our kitchen sink. A lot (I mean, a lot) of grease. All of it came up.

I have not eaten or purchased food from this restaurant in years. Maybe it was a bad day for the cook. My daughter did not experience any symptoms (she did not eat any of the chili fries though). My recommendation is to avoid the chili cheese fries, if you do plan to eat here.More",April 2016,Hi Life Burgers

I went to this place in Dec '12 for a quick business lunch. Although it's likely a locals favorite, the locals likely live within a three block radius. Tortas and tacos best described as average.

It is by far my favorite fast food mex/american hybrid restaurant of all time.  My business was in...downtown for years and i have now moved it to Glendale.  I live in the foothills 30 minutes away, but i still yearn for this place and make excuses to get there whenever possible.  The New Crowd will inevitably order the carne asada fries, BYOB and nachos, which are very good drunken food, but let me tell you where this place really shines:
 Here is my inside list"" of go-tos:
1.  Special Quesadilla with Pastrami.   This is the BOMB.  Do not expect a crispy boring quesadilla with sour cream and guac.  This is a meal:   juicy lean chopped pastrami with green chili, chopped tomatoes, cheese and guac.   It is wet, soft and must be eaten with a fork and knife.  You will not be disappointed.
2.  Any of the following burritos:  Steak Picado, Green Chile or Red Chile but ask for cheese added and easy beans.   I really don't have a better place that meets these burritos for quality, taste and continuity.   
3.  Hard Shell Beef Taco.    These are messy but incredible.
4.  Cheeseburger with Chili.  Again, the meld of ingredients with that chili sauce is a taste hard to describe.
5.  Green Sauce on the side with any of the above.

CoCoCounty,50.0,"Last night while in downtown LA at my hotel, I decided to dig through the many options on DoorDash. I came across El Huero based on price and positive reviews. I ordered a Taco plate with rice and beans, as well as a bean and...cheese burrito. The food was hot and fresh. I was amazed when I opened the taco plate to see the tacos had all the toppings you normally have to pay extra for, like diced tomatoes, guacamole, and shredded lettuce and sour cream on the side. Of course they also had cilantro and onions. They were over stuffed and the taste was amazing. Included was green and red hot sauce in containers. Even though this place offers a drive thru and quick service, the portions and quality are that of a sit down restaurant. I will definitely visit again when I’m in the area. The bean and cheese burrito was also great. The beans tasted freshly made that day unlike other places I’ve had.More",January 2019,El Huero

Actually, 4 words: VERY GOOD DOLLAR TACOS!

Cash only! (C'mon, obvs it's a taco stand)

Al Pastor - freaking amazing. The meat ratio is RIDICULOUS, especially for $1. Seriously, once you start on the garnish station, you've got some mountains on...your plate.
Carne Asada can be pretty dry. We ate here 4 nights out of our 3 weeks in so-cal, got some pretty dry carne asada twice, and stuck with al pastor tacos.

You start at the far end, away from w ave 26. Let them know how many, what meats, and watch them go. They are crazy busy every night, but these guys work quick. 20 tacos? Alright, watch that appear on your plate in 20 seconds.
Pick up some potatoes (in the foil pack), pay the worker standing beside the line, and move onto  drinks and garnish.

At the garnish station, you`ll find the staples. Onion+cilatro, radish, limes and spicy red onion. Followed by 3 sauces: red, mild green, and a spicy guac that does not play around. 
You`ll also find sandwich bags and plastic cups to pack them for home.

But it's the grilled onions, you`ll really want! The ones back at the meat station. TRUST ME.

It doesn't look like it, but there is plenty of parking available.

If you're just visiting LA, don't wait until your last day to visit. You`ll want more.

As angelenos, especially of Mexican descend, we know good tacos, so we were curious to try the best taco...in America. Around 8pm in a Friday, the line was quite long but moved fast. We waited for about 10 minutes, and it was our turn. 

There are many choices - brisket, carne asada, el pastol, chicken, pork head, and pork stomach (strips?). We went with brisket, carne asada, and el pastol. The brisket tacos were DELICIOUS!!! I would say it’s the best brisket tacos I have ever had :) asada and el pastol are ok; I don’t think they are the beat tacos in the states, but they were still very good. 

Three different kinds of salsa are available for self-serve. Cutter onions, cilantro, lime, and pickled onion (spicy) are also there. If one wants grilled onions, make sure one asks when ordering :)

There was rice, curried, buttered chicken, chickpeas, pico de gallo and cilantro on top. The deal came with a fountain drink, I had peach flavored Barq's creme soda. I sat and used their free WiFi to catch up on some emails and other matters, and I have to say I ate it all, every bite.

NormKeith,40.0,"We were driving by and saw the word chutney, we both like chutney, found a parking spot and were very glad to stop.  You order from the counter and the meal is built as you pick your ingredients . You start with a flat round...baked bread.  We ordered  the Kati Rolls, one Lamb and Peas Keema (ground lamb and peas cooked with onion, chilis, and garlic) and one Grilled Chicken Tikka (chicken marinated in yogurt, citrus and spices .  After choosing your protein you choose from a number of toppings than it is rolled up.   After paying you go to the chutney bar and pick your chutneys.  We really liked their roasted peppers chutney.  I had the lamb and my girlfriend had the chicken.   The unique taste was so good we went back and ordered another two Kati Rolls.  The restaurant is nice and light, very clean and comfortable.  The only reason I am not given 5 bobbles is when we started choosing I verbally ordered and pointed to what I wanted.  The fellow behind the counter started fixing something I didn't ordered and I mentioned it to him  and he disagreed with me and was very rude as he started over making what I had ordered.  Later I found out he was the manager.  The two women behind the counter were very friendly and did a good job finishing my order.  The food was excellent.More",April 2018,California Chutney
ChaplainAmerica,50.0,This place is simply AMAZING.  I wish I lived closer--I would be a regular customer.  It's like an Indian Chipotle--you go through the line designing your tacos (with naan bread) or bowl or plate exactly the way you want it.  The price is inexpensive and...the food portions are generous.  You need to go... you will be so glad you did!More,March 2018,California Chutney
Jack D,40.0,"This restaurant is like fast food.  You order at the counter, your meal is assembled in front of you on a tray; pay at the register; then find a seat.  You can serve yourself with various sauces.

The food is tasty.  There are 4 or...5 ""proteins"" to choose from, including vegetarian options.  They are not afraid to use lots of spices for flavor and some dishes are even a bit spicy.  The Naan is baked fresh in their Tandoori ovens.  

While the setting is definitely casual, I think the flavor is much better than other Indian restaurants in Pasadena.More",September 2017,California Chutney
Mark E,40.0,"On my own on a business trip so I look for simple but tasty dining options.  The reviewer who compared to chipotle was spot on.  You order your protein the style (bowl or plate) and extras.  

I had roasted veggie curry which is vegan as...a plate dinner with lentil soup.  Chose plate versus plate versus rice bowl in order to have naan included. 

Excellent flavors.  Nice balance with soup, rice, and curry.  

Server was friendly and helpful and let me try the iced chai before buying.  

I thought the naan was wonderful texture but too heavy on raw garlic.  But I am not a huge garlic fan.  

Soup and curry were both warm rather than hot.  

I did not realize there was a fountain station and chutney bar around the side.  

A few beers on tap. 

Nice bright well lit dining area with views onto the shopping dining area of Pasadena.  

$11.99 for the plate dinner and $3.50 for chai.  I think good value.  

Would definitely return.More",August 2017,California Chutney

We ordered two cheeseburgers and one regular fry and one large drink. Our total was $25 plus change. Kind of pricey for the run down tables and unkept dining floor. But to be fair, they do make a fresh quality burger. You are just paying about a 35% premium over in n out or the habit. They do use more meat so this could be what warrants the higher price. The regular fry was just under $5 and I got a small cup for that price. Needless to say, I kept looking at the in n out next door and wish we had gone there.

In my Opinion, this is not a fast food restaurant:

In all seriousness, though, for those not familiar with the chain, Jollibee has a serviceable if limited menu and seems to be expanding its reach in Southern California....Though not quite ready to be a serious competitor in the SoCal burger wars, the Jollibee burger is worth a try. Be aware, however, that Jollibee burgers taste distinctly different than traditional American-style hamburgers. I can't put my finger on it exactly, but Jollibee patties have a unique flavor that I've not encountered at any other burger chain. I can't say I'm in love with it, but it's definitely worth a try if you're in the mood for something different.

The listed price was $14 on the board but we were charged $17.08, rather suprisingly; it turns out that we were charged $15 (which should not happen), and they added a ""LA healthy tax"", which I have never encountered before.  For a medium-sized rice bowl at a market where you have to stand in line and order at the counter, this price seems excessive.  But I would say the food was above average though by no means memorable.More",December 2018,Sari Sari Store

Skip it and go across the street to the north to the Taco Bell.  They have the solution to the problem there.  You have to either put in a quarter to use the restroom, or you can get a free token with purchase.

Greco's New York Pizzeria (Highland) looks like one of the old school places you would often see everyone hanging out in in a movie or TV show. It feels like an authentic American experience for any overseas visitors and you know you are in the right place when the locals eat there too. 

As for price to feed myself & son (who are big eaters) 2 slices and 2 drinks cost us around $20 (USD), I know this doesn't necessarily sound cheap to some of you but it is when you see the size of the slice & drink. If you were in a bigger group / family then don't order by the slice, order the whole ""pie"".

MooshLA,40.0,"Stopped by this place one weeknight last week to check it out as I'm a fan of fresh poke. I liked it overall however some constructive notes include that the menu is a bit confusing as it almost requires someone to walk you through ordering...(ie, how are we supposed to know that ""Bamboo Rice"" is just white rice). The create-your-own mix is a nice option and you could walk away with some pretty flavorful bowls. The unfortunate aspect is that I went one night following the gym at ~8:50P and the store was practically shut down. I had to ask if they were still open - which they are, nightly during the week until 9:30P however the staff were actively closing down the store probably so everyone could walk out at 9:30P on the dot instead of closing things down. Therefore some options were no longer available when I ordered simply because they had put away for the night.More",May 2019,Sweetfin

Yes, they are taken back from the spartan looks of the place. Oh , don't let that fool you so here are some tips on making your Tommy experience nice and pleasant. 
1. KNOW YOUR ORDER....ORDER QUICK and ORDER CORRECT
2. Have it with the chili always..it ain't a Tommy without the Chili
3. Jalapenos, grab a small basket and leave it at that.
4. Bus your own table....but be cordial and friendly if needed.
5. Don't bear rush your meal...savor the looks of it...savor the smell....it does look overwhelming and you try to ponder how to conquer this monstrous delight but carry on and be calm.
6. Chili with fries? Why not?
7. Wipe mouth and face.

End of day...It's not something that I eat everyday....but when I do eat one, it is something that I appreciate and enjoy immensely.

Gabriel O,30.0,"I've worked in DTLA for thirteen years and I finally tried this place. I hate the parking everywhere in LA but sometimes you have to bite the bullet and go. So we tried this joint because my coworker says, ""You gotta have Al and Beas....I love that place"". Okay then take me to it. 
I had their special burrito. The price is okay. But the beans were flavorless and the guy that wrapped my burrito made it look like a taco but not because it's overstuffed. Because they don't know how to wrap a burro. I can get better flavor at Chanos or even Jims down the street. It's unfortunate, because with better flavored food and larger tortillas, they could get away with charging double. Good food draws. This kind of food is for people that live in walking distance and don't know any better.
It's alright for the price. The place itself is cool as its like restaurant made out of part of the house. Very LA identity but the actual food is not as unique.More",April 2018,Al & Bea's Mexican Food

- Don't have to drive all the way to Pasadena for carne asada goodness - it's the best one in town.
- Parking situation better than Pasadena - park on Louis curbside or public parking at the...corner
- THREE...THREE cashiers instead of one-two in Pasadena.  The first time I went was Friday Lunch hour, waited in line for 7 minutes and got my take-out in 10 minutes.  The food was just as good/same.  The carnitas was cooked just right - no grease ith a little crunch on the edges.
- For now the variety of the menu is GOOD enough!  Notice the HD display... that means they can add more to it in the future.  This is better than the static board display in Pasadena.
- Those that complain about the service... do you see those guys hustling back there?!  This is a fast food place, not the Ritz, so chill out.
- For those naysayers that are just absolutely devastated/outraged about the lack of breakfast burritos at this location I say this:  Get to know your history:  there were no breakfast burritos at Pasadena when it first opened either.  Give these guys time to settle in.
- Lastly, two words and a must for hot sauce-loving fanatics get the ""Red Sauce"" or if you're feeling fancy:order  ""Salsa Rojas""

Chop an entire unwashed lettuce and trow it in a bowl?   The butt of the lettuce was in one piece, a part of the salads together with all the hard portions of the leaves that any self respecting cook or reputable restaurant would remove.  You could tasted the unlistenable flavor on unwashed lettuce.  A few pieces of dry chicken and some wontons and that is what they call a salad.

bppiatek,50.0,"Just before going to a film screening we dropped into Vicious Dogs for the first time.   Unpretentious despite the name, it was a great experience!

We had a hot dog, very good onion rings and flavorful 'home made' potato salad and a really great bratwurst....The brat brought  back flavor memories from my childhood in Wisconsin.  Wherever they get them, Vicious Dogs then cranks up the flavor by splitting and grilling the wurst.  The dog buns were also just right, very fresh, soft and with good flavor.  That was also a good choice

I had mine with onions (chopped and grilled) and relish plus a nod to living for 25 years in NM, jalapeños, in lieu of green chile (gotta have some heat!)

We will go back again for an inexpensive, flavorful, friendly meal!!More",September 2017,Vicious Dogs
KirbyB48,50.0,"I am from Chicago and I've had the best hot dogs there (Gene and Jude's, etc.). Vicious Dogs has them beat by far.  Their bun in nutritious and sturdy (it doesn't fall apart when eating ...which REALLY irks me).  The dogs are ALL BEEF, but...also top notch quality.  Finally, their Chicago Dog is their BEST DOG by far and is unmatched by ANY Chicago Dog in the state of Illinois.  They have an array of different ""dogs"" you can try and for those unfortunate non meat eaters ....veggie dogs.  All Dogs are prepared AFTER you order them and great care seems to be put into each order.  The Dogs are then brought out to your table individually! The owner came out to my table and said hi and actually remembered me from last month when I brought my son in while he was home from College in San Francisco.  This place is not just a hot dog place but a culinary delight and a boutique cafe.  You'll be doing yourself a disservice if you don't stop in here.  By the way, you HAVE to try the CHICAGO DOG!More",April 2017,Vicious Dogs

TravelingMerm,40.0,"I visited as part of the #localadventurechallenge back in late September. This one is off the corner of Manchester and La Cienega...very busy location, lots of traffic. We opted to park and walk up instead of going in the drive through bc the line was...sticking out into busy traffic. BUT that line moves super fast - we should’ve just done the drive through bc we waited in the walk up line an insanely long time - over 40 minutes! There’s plenty of parking, but the drive through was much faster just FYI.

Their prices are very fair - they charge a tiny bit more than other places, but their donuts were also quite a bit bigger than other places. We got the Lemon Old Fashioned, Raspberry Filled, Strawberry Filled and a Cream Filled Long John and ate them over the course of 3-4 days bc they were so huge lol! They were all really good - plenty of filling but not so much that it’s dripping out and just the right amount of sweetness. The Lemon Old Fashioned was my fave one! Crispy on the outside and soft and cakey on the inside and a great amount of lemon flavor! Loved it!

The staff were just ok - they weren’t overly welcoming but they were super busy slammed.More",October 2020,Randy's Donuts

elizabethlascheid,30.0,"So many love Randy's Donuts, so I am on outlier I guess, but I am also a local and I have never been impressed and find their donuts greasy and just okay at best. And I am a nut for donuts: Keep them away from...me or I will eat 3 at a time and get a stomach ache. 

Randy's might want you to think they were the ones that put that huge donut on top of the square boring building, but they bought it like that in about 1963 or so. Before that it was The Big Donut and there was more than one. There are still more than one donut shop with the huge donut on top of the building. This one was built around 1953 or so. When I was very young, it was really good, even after it became Randy's, but by the 70's it got super greasy and I moved on.

Now, I still go there--I feel forced, but I do it with a smile. Anyone I know from out of town wants to go to Randy's. No problem. I was just there 4 days ago and it is just as boring as ever. The place has a huge line, parking is a bear, the area is not great, get off the freeway and get your donuts and do not keep going West--East is fine, keep going and you will find the Forum, a great concert venue, and other donut shops that are great and not well known and cost less as well.

So go to Randy's. Get it over with, you can say you were there. But great it is not. Have fun anyway.More",July 2020,Randy's Donuts
Julesbusiness,50.0,"We were staying overnight at an Inglewood motel and as it was close, and iconic, decided that our road trip breakfast would be donuts from Randy’s. Nice and easy to locate and when you are close there no problems seeing the famous donut sign on...top of the building.

Good parking around the building and when we were there at breakfast time it was non-stop with cars going through the drive-thru section. There is kiosk window at the front of the building and without a doubt an extensive donut menu. We went for three donuts along with two coffees and everything was perfect. These really are the best donuts and way beyond any hype that other providers may claim for theirs, the real test is in the texture and taste. Service was friendly and speedy and I’m very happy that we visited.

Al G,50.0,"We passed Randy's Donuts many times on our various trips to Los Angeles. We finally decided to see what created the lineups that we seemed to see at all times of the day. Our first visit informed us why Randy's is so popular.Once we tried...the donuts, we were devastated that we hadn't tried them before.

The location, very near LAX, is in a nondescript semi-industrial area, but by the variety of cars in the overflowing parking lot, customers are attracted from a wide area.

The first problem with ordering, once you've reached the order window, is an astonishing number of choices displayed on the menu boards. Over two visits, with three in our party, we sampled six different varieties; all delicious! We were tempted to order a couple of dozen different varieties, just to experiment, but ultimately decided to leave exploration to future visits.

The facility is in what appears to be a '50s era drive-in at the intersection of two main thoroughfares. The distinctive donut atop the building is iconic, appearing in many movie and video productions, perhaps the latest being ""Donovan"" on Netflix. It's even visible on the approach to landing at LAX, if you know where to look. The interior is abuzz with employees manning the order windows, taking drive-through orders, restocking the many racks of donuts, and hidden from view, what must be a very efficient kitchen.

I'm sure almost everyone has a favourite local donut shop, but Randy's must rate among the best in the world!More",January 2020,Randy's Donuts

I get the cauliflower crust, no cheese, chicken breast meat, and other veggies on it. Finished with arugula! Delicious and nutritious!

elizabethlascheid,50.0,"This Five Guys is located in the Culver City, Westfield Mall. Just turn into the mall and park near Macy's. It is located on the outside of the mall on the North side. 

We love this Five Guys and always go to this one. The...manager is great and the place is always spotless. Service is very good and it does not take long to get your meal. They have a nice selection of burgers, fries, shakes, etc. There is something there for everyone. A vegan would not be happy, but a vegetarian can find something.

We just love their service. They are great at making your order the way you want it and they get it right the first time. All of the food is fresh and prepared for you. It is not usually too crowded, so you will be able to find a table and get your food in short order. You can, of course, get it to go and I assume a place like Grub Hub delivers.

When you walk in you will see rows and rows of shelled peanuts for you to have at no charge. The place is cute in red and white tile. You get in line to order your food and your receipt will have a number on it for you to pick it up. It is all made right in front of you.

It is really a step above fast food. It is super tasty and you will be happy. It is kid friendly, my grandson loves this place. Have fun.More",July 2018,Five Guys

All orders come with chips and salsa which is probably the plus here.  HOWEVER, the salsa is absolutely watered down without flavor.  It's apparent they took a tomato and a lot of water and blended it and called it salsa.  If they do this to their salsa how much more with their food.  Since it is fast food, they are about quantity here rather than quality.  It literally taste like Taco Bell minus the Taco Bell taste.

This branch boasts a sleek, clean interior and the same tasty Chinese food that locals have come...to expect from Panda Express.  There is a wide variety of choices, with vegetarian options, as well as gluten-free offerings.

The 2-entree plate comes with your two choices of entree, plus a side (steamed rice, fried rice, chow mein, steamed vegetables).  I always ask for ""half-and-half,"" meaning half fried rice & half chow mein.  The most popular entree is their famous Orange Chicken, which is crunchy, sweet & a little spicy.  The other entrees feature beef, shrimp, pork or vegetarian (for example, eggplant).  Of course, there are egg rolls & fortune cookies, too.

I almost had to cancel a trip to Europe, but JUST managed to get ""well"" enough to get to...the airport on the 13th before my flight. I called the Hut from the airport and spoke to the manager. i explained that I had just started eating at both locations over the last 2-3 months and had become quite the regular, but that I would never come back after the hell I'd just gone through (I KNOW it was from them, I only eat once a day). He apologized and took my number and said the owner would call me when I return from my trip to offer me compensation, so we'll see if that happens (I'll update this review), but I made it clear that I wasn't coming back and didn't want freebies, just that I was hurt because I really had (up until feeling like I was literally at Death's door due to getting sick) enjoyed the heck out of their food. The LEAST they could do is refund my money, including my Uber ride to the pharmacy, as I was in no shape to drive and had no one to go for me. I'm waiting to see if the owner calls me (again, the manager said he would and took my number) to see how I'm going to proceed with this.

Had the blackjack quesadilla and a short rib taco.  Quesadilla.  Too much cheese which overpowered the other flavors and textures.  Couldn't really taste the meat and carmelized onions...thru the cheese, but I think they were ok.  Tortilla crisp, but way too greasy.  Good salsa.  I've had quesadillas at Little League snack bars that were as good and cheaper.  Come on.  How hard is it too melt cheese in a tortilla and pour on a little salsa?  Short rib taco.  This was good.  Meat was tasty, and salsas / relishes tasty.  Still.  I've had a lot of tacos as good or better from your standard taco truck and yes cheaper.  Nothing really set this one apart.  

Also.  You have to order from a poorly designed and poorly programmed computer screen.  It was kind of a hassle.  I work with computers most of the day.

The food is made from the BEST ingredients and the staff really knows what they are doing!  Some of the original employees from when they first opened are still there - that's called a clue.

I also like that it's a local place, and not a chain -- I think this keeps them a bit more responsive to local patrons.

I wish I had read the reviews before. I would really avoid this place! The attendant will pressure you into leaving a tip - to the point where I left one because I was terrified...that she was going to spit into my food. This is a FAST CASUAL style place - tips are optional. She did not bring it to me. I worked at a fast-casual place for YEARS and never shook people down like that, esp. since there's a 3.5% charge for credit cards.
The po-boys are a generous size but don't let that fool you. As a previous person said, they are filled with lemons with the rind still on - I had a partial sticker on mine and I just wanted to throw up. I wanted to complain but she was so insane, pacing around, mumbling to herself, that I was terrified to be honest. She should be fired but this is probably a mom & pop place.
The meatloaf po-boy my partner got was good (no weird lemon) but it had straight up mayo on it (not remoulade) which was weird.
The gumbo is TERRIBLE - like someone threw some Dinty Moore Meat & Rice into Campbell's tomato soup.
The hush puppies are not full corn, they are ground. Sauce was great but the hush puppies were REALLY dry.
Honestly, the only reason I give two stars is because the sandwiches are big. But the attitude needs to go, the prices are much higher than I expected.More",December 2019,Gumbo Pot

lowbuxlux,30.0,"I've been here a few times. They have good sammiches..yes I said sammich.  ;)
You can get a sammich like you make at home. Piled on with meat and sliced loaf bread. 

The food is good here, but here's where the place gets the 3...stars...

The parking MORE THAN STINKS.  There should be a law against businesses  with bad parking. If there were  this place would be the first violator.  

Truly the parking will  turn you off. After fighting for a space with someone who was there less time than you, you'll have to SQUEEZE your regular size car into a spot in some funky angle while someone is double parked.

After the hassle of 5 to 15 minute parking wars you FINALLY make it in the door and then you flip a coin...will you get a nice person today or someone with a crap poo tude? At this point you're only in the mood for a nice smiling face because you had to fight for parking and you're  probably hungry or even hangry. 

Finally you get your sammich, make sure you buy  a drink because when you walk out you'll have another obstacle waiting.  Walk out and great! 2 cars are blocking you in. Really?! 

*sigh*

So you now can act a fool and lay on the horn or just patiently wait while eating your sammich. Glad you got the drink now I'm sure. 

If you come at the sweet spot time, you're good to go.  Not easy to catch but if you do catch it, go in and enjoy a yummy sammich.More",March 2017,Mike's Deli

Shiroh,30.0,"Some places you go to for the food. Other places you go for the atmosphere. This is the latter. The claim that it was rated LA's #1 burger by a local radio station made me question the rater's objectivity or expertise.

The burgers are small...and fried to well done. There isn't much going on in the flavor department. The kosher pickle on the side was a nice touch, though. One area this place stands out is in the ice-to-beverage ratio. I felt like I was drinking my Diet Coke from a snowball. The free refills are welcome, but I felt a bit chutzpadik after asking for one refill to go back for yet another. I don't drink all that much, and I drained my first serving so quickly that even the second left me wanting.

This would be a good place to bring some friends from other countries to show them what American kitsch looks like. The signs are funny, and the bright red plastic Coke signs and other decorations scream American pop culture. Friendly service is a nice plus. The owner seems nice, and a few customers walking in during my time there seemed to know him and be known by him. It looks like they have a decent local following.More",June 2015,Hamburger Habit Wla

NatGranadaHills,40.0,"The overall review is positive although I do not think this is the best middle eastern food I ever had. 
The place itself is a little run down from the furniture, to the counter and the actual place where the food is located.
Now to...the food, I ordered beef shawarma and it was just ok, the meat itself was practically shredded so I couldn't really figure out the quality of it and the seasoning itself was pretty basic, the sauce honestly I didn't like.
My friend ordered the chicken burrito and I think this is one of their signature dishes, pretty much the same experience.
May be I was expecting much more from the reviews I read and went in with very high expectations.

There is enough for 2 to share, the flavor and texture of the shawarma are superior to that prepared at many other ""fast food"" Israeli establishments I've tried, and, to top it off, the service is so friendly.  The menu includes lemon chicken, a variety of meats for kabobs, falafel, gyros, Lebanese, Greek and Israeli salads, grape leaves, vegetarian plates, fresh-made Laffa bread, dips and of course baklava and Turkish coffee.

That does not bother me. I think part of this is due to...Covid and the lines will start to move faster once Covid is over. The service is still the best, fast and friendly and they usually get your order right.

Sadly, they now will only make burgers well done, in other words, close to burned. That really takes some the taste away from their great meat. I enjoy my rare and can't get that, but they were usually willing to  make a burger medium. No longer. They can call it medium all day, but it is very well done.

Moving beyond the ever so well done burgers, the rest is great. The fries are wonderful and fresh, their shake are creamy and wonderful. You can have your burger made in many different ways, except the cooking, they have a ""secret"" menu that is not so secret.

The selections are soft tacos, burritos, sopes, and quesadillas with your selections of meats.  They also have very good tamales along with a few side dishes like rice and beans.

I typically will order an all meat burrito or maybe with some beans included.  They will happily exclude adding rice if you're like me and don't care for it in burritos.  This Pico Rivera location is walking distance from my house.  I've been eating here for years and though I haven't eaten at any other King Taco locations, I'm pretty sure that they standardize the food in their restaurants so you will get consistent quality wherever and whenever you go.

gcfam79,20.0,"King Taco is THE best place for a taco run. Despite the fact that this is almost fast food and not family home cooking, it's really good!!! I have never had a bad experience. BUT....this location needs some work in the service area and parking....Service: Having been here quite a few times, there's been more than enough times where lines are long and there's only one register open. I don't get it. There's been times when they close registers when there's long lines. It's weird. As well, the wait for the food....25-35 minutes. But I guess it hasn't hurt business, people keep coming in. Although, it's not a good way to treat your customers.... whatever though, I'm the one spending money and they are happily taking it.

Parking: Parking at the PR location is TERRIBLE!!! There's only one way in and out. I didn't know this was legal but it is I guess. The set up is like an upside down""L."" You go in, straight and to the left, if there's no parking, you're out of luck. Good luck trying to back out because there's a line of cars behind you who are looking for parking and will not let you back out. If you see a line of cars, it ain't worth it...go somewhere else because you are going to be trapped and really no where to go. Their parking lot and set up needs improvement....BIG TIME!!!

Healthy hamburgers, hot dogs, chili, burritos, all vegetarian.  I really like eating the hotdogs with mustard and onions, or chili, knowing I am avoiding all the dangers I've read about concerning hotdogs. 

The fries are not deep fat fried, but ""air fried"" so you avoid all the rancid, old, greasy cheap oil on your fries.  Whoohoo!!!

I attempt to eat only organic soy, so not sure if they are ""caught up"" with the news on that.

Call your order in ahead and go and pick it up, I suggest, because if you order hotdogs, they may be a little too cold when they are hurrying to get your order out. (-- My experience.  I ate mine a little too cold, but I did not have any ""symptoms"" from it.)

Travelbug880,30.0,"Eating their chicken on a regular basis is setting yourself up for a heart attack. This is greasy, heavily coated Louisiana style fried chicken. Plus, the style of  coleslaw has a lot of sugar as part of the recipe. The red beans and rice are...not the way my mama cooked them. More rice than beans here. The green beans look and taste like slop.  The popcorn shrimp is decent.

Meredith A,40.0,"This one has a free parking lot in back!  That's seriously the reason we ate here after our Warner Brothers Studio tour, nowhere else on Riverside had parking, haha.  But lucky for us, we all had a great meal at Lemonade.  Not a ton of...seating - there's some inside and some out - but lots of people waiting in line will get takeout and not sit in.  We didn't have trouble finding a table for 4 during weekday lunchtime.

You can taste all the salad items before buying, which is great, but it's hard to imagine how one could go wrong here anyway.  I got the lemongrass chicken slaw with cabbage and cashews, roasted broccoli with ricotta cheese and champagne vinaigrette, Hawaiian Ahi tuna poke with sesame vinaigrette, and cucumber mint lemonade.  This was probably around $15.  So no, it isn't cheap.  But I've come to expect that as normal from LA - the food is really good, very fresh, catering to a crowd that apparently doesn't mind paying a little extra for that goodness.  I enjoyed everything - loved the crunchy slaw, the tuna was fresh and in big yummy chunks drizzled in wonderful sesame dressing, and the lemonade was a big, refreshing glass of goodness.  

It's a little hard to know exactly how much of which things to get to make a full meal.  Easy to accidentally get too much salad and then wish you had saved room for the hot stuff.  I wish it was easier to really get a look at everything before you decide.  I think my mom ended up with too much and was passing off (delicious) chicken meatballs on the rest of us, and I was scraping my plate with my fork, wishing I'd got another salad portion!  But overall the experience is of a fun, modern cafeteria with way more delicious food than you'll have belly space (or wallet space) to try.More",March 2016,Lemonade

When we arriving at this restaurant we didn’t really...understand what we were dealing with, but got in line, and ordered our favorite, cheeseburgers animal-style.

fyremaven,50.0,"We live on the border of Norwalk and Downey so this is our ""go to"" Chick Fil A place and boy, are we happy about it. Most people already understand that when you go to any Chick Fil A, you are going to get a...high caliber of service and product but this place is just fantastic! 
Not only do they do a VERY high volume - even more at times than the nearby In N Out (which is saying something!) but they always produce the same high quality product and impeccable customer service...now how many places can you say that about? In this day and age where customer service is king, Chick Fil A in general is leading the pack and this location in particular. 
I have to say - and this is so rare - that they literally have NEVER made a mistake on any of our orders. Crazy, right? Pretty much unheard of. Previous to this, McDonalds had been doing pretty well, but because they are human they would make occasional mistakes and were happy to remediate them when you show them what happened. But this place has never even made a mistake and we go there probably once a week.
Same high quality product, same condition when you get food (everything hot and tasty) and same delicious taste. The staff is invariably cheerful and make you happy you came there to spend your hard-earned dollars. They don't blink when you ask for 2 or 3 BBQ sauces (believe me some places get upset or charge more) and they always make sure you are happy.
Sound unbelievable?? I know!! Go check them out, don't worry if there is a long line, it won't take long and you will soon have steaming hot delicious chicken and yummy thick criss cross fries to make your tummy happy!! :)More",July 2017,Chick-fil-A

I couldn't resist ordering me one.  It had wonderful flavor, and I loved it! The Habit also offers a nice pepper bar in the lobby.  Our Charburger came with pickles, lettuce, tomatoes, and caramelized onions.  After we got to the car and started to eat our burger, I was wishing we each got our own.  It was amazing!

BOBreviewed,30.0,It tries to be a cut above the typical hamburger joint but to me it really does not stand out.  Burgers are average with some nice alternatives and side dishes.  Good fries.

The quality of the food is uneven.
We tried the following - the Pastrami burger, the chili fries, the regular fries and the Ahi Tuna salad. 

Order #1
The...Pastrami burger was pretty good. 
The fries - could use a more flavorful oil - like corn oil.  But you can always add your spices or whatever to zest it up, I suppose. There was a LOT of it - at least two meals worth.

Order #2
The Chili Fries - lots of raw onion and tomato bits and chili. Pretty good. 
The Ahi Tuna - AVOID THIS TOTALLY. The salad part of this was fine. And plentiful - also made two meals out of it. (Just get the salad)

But the tuna was not fresh. It was over-cooked. And tasted as if it had been sitting around in that condition all day. I threw that out.More",April 2019,The Stand

However, I have visited several times this past few months while I was in the area only to note...that at $9.00 for a falafel sandwich, it's a rip off! I ordered a regular falafel pita sandwich and added two toppings which came to $9.22.  The pita was barely filled. At the bottom was not even a teaspoon of each added item. I thought they forgot to put it in! Then a sprinkle of lettuce only 3 falafel balls and a couple of very small pieces of tomatoe. It sure was not what I am used to getting from the Falafel Palace!!!!!!!!!! This was also consistent with my past few visits. Same disappointment and little food for the price.Way too expensive for what you get. I had to fill up on the cabbage and pickles!! They need to cut the price or go back to the years gone by of the owner overseeing everything! Food quality remains consistent. If you like my review please give me a like vote.

Umbrellas are right on the sun deck 20m away of the tables and yet Tray the manager told us they were just stored there for another use! What other use than protecting customers from sun, that is still a secret.

rhea_rill,30.0,"Atmosphere
Very plain. Aside from the meat display case, there are some tables, chairs, area to get water and 3 TV's. No decor. Could definitely use some upgrading and maybe some cleaning.
Location
Near a busy intersection of Melrose and La Brea. A few parking...spaces in a tiny lot but it's shared with about two other places to eat. You literally have to drive on the sidewalk to park in one of the spots. There is parking in the back but it maybe by valet only. I just drove by it. There is street parking as well.
Service
The guy was OK. He just took our order, took payment and called me when my food was ready. Didn't give that warm welcome that other eateries usually give.
Prices
Regular $8.95
Large $10.95
Extra for additional requests( extra meat, bacon, avocado, etc)

My daughter and I tried the Veggie options. She got the burrata and I got the caprese. We got the smaller sizes and traded each other half of each of ours so we can taste both. I didn't care for the caprese. Best part about it was the buffalo mozzarella. The burrata was more flavorful. It had burrata, sundried tomatoes, fresh basil, homemade pesto, tomatoes and roasted peppers. I should've know that would've been the better of the two. Perfect blend of flavors. 
It was decent but the regular(meat/tuna)sandwiches are probably worth eating more than the veggie sandwiches. If I come back, I'll try the tunaMore",October 2017,All About The Bread

BruinDan,50.0,"Located at the corner of Colorado Boulevard and Merlon Avenue in a nondescript neighborhood on the east side of Pasadena, The Original Tops is a long-time local favorite.  In fact, its slogan is “Not Just an Institution, But a Dining Tradition Since 1952.”  NOTE that...while they have a decent-sized parking lot, both the lot and the drive-thru can fill up during peak meal times; so opting for street parking along Merlon Avenue might get you in and out more quickly.

When you get in line to order at the counter, you’ll be faced with a menu board of impressive proportions.  You’ll find sections dedicated to breakfast, soups and salads, charbroiled burgers, “signature sandwiches,” “South of the Border Specials,” “family favorites,” “Tops dinner plates” and “signature sides.”

We opted for some of their better-known menu items.  I went for their pastrami sandwich, while my son ordered their signature Tops Special burger, which is topped with pastrami, cheese, lettuce, tomato, red onions, pickles and sauce.  One nice thing about Tops is that they cut their sandwiches in half, so we were able to share.  The pastrami was stacked high with moist, tender pastrami on a nice roll.  The Tops Special burger was simply amazing.  We also shared a small order of fries, which was plenty large for two people.  We left full and satisfied – we ate at Tops before attending a football game at the Rose Bowl, and were never tempted to purchase any of the overpriced concessions there.

The service was efficient, the dining room was kept remarkably tidy given the amount of business, and the prices were very fair.  There is a reason The Original Tops has been feeding hungry locals for over 60 years, and I would strongly recommend a visit.More",November 2019,The Original Tops

I order my  tacos the same time EVERY TIME, and yet they tried to charge me $3 extra for cabbage. Mind you, if you walk up to the...window on the inside and ask for cabbage, they give it to you for free!!! My order was $9.71 when I was at the speaker, but somehow they decided to charge me extra by the time I made it to the drive thru window. I explained to them that I've never been charged for cabbage previously, and I even produced receipts that showed no charge for cabbage. I had them redo my order because I was adamant about not paying extra simply because someone wanted to charge me more today. Then, they remake my order completely wrong!!! I go back, and there's no apology. So, I demand my money back. When I asked for the manager, it was the same person who didn't see any point in apologizing or even trying to turn around a clearly bad experience.

As a first time, I totally misunderstood the concept and was standing at the cash register for quite a while before I was told the line starts on the other side. There wasn't a ""START HERE"" sign. It's like a SUBWAY where you tell the staff what you want in your burrito and they add it as they slide the tortilla down the counter.
I know this chain is popular but I thought the burritos were overpriced--though maybe the add your own choice of ingredients might be the fun part of it.

I tried 1 each of the carnitas (fried shredded pork), the cabeza (head meat) and the al pastor (BBQ pork). None were outstanding, but each was a delicious, slightly messy 5 bites worth. Could have added cheese and avocado for a little extra - maybe next time. Sides of pickled carrot, hot pepper, radish and a half lime were nice touches. Horchata with refill was sweet and good.

Rolandtheking,20.0,I was at LAX early in the morning and wanted to grab a bite to take on the plane with me. I ordered the Farmers skillet which said it was eggs and bacon and such in it. When I ordered the young girl scooped some...potatoes into the plate and then a slice of the skillet. She closed the lid with potatoes hanging out the side and handed me the plate. I boarded the plane and began to eat and found no meat or anything else in the big chunk of egg. The flavor was okay but fell well short of expectation and promise of what I was to receive. After paying 18$ for that and a coffee I was highly disappointed.More,June 2019,Lemonade
ExpoNationals,40.0,"Lemonade is not your typical lemonade stand one would find on a neighborhood corner run by the kiddos.  They are so much more than that.  We first discovered this chain at LAX airport inside Terminal 5 (after the security checkpoint).

Visited them twice.  First time...was before our redeye flight to Orlando.  We got a customized Poke bowl to go.  Was not expecting much, but we were happily surprised.  When shared that Poke bowl on the plane our eyes lit up.  The Poke was delish!!  Everything tasted fresh and awesome!!  When we arrived back from Florida,  we went back to Lemonade before going to the Baggage Claim.  Got their Poke again, and it was as good as before.  Also shared a Peanut Butter Brittle cookie which was yummy and a refreshing Lemonade drink.

JOEJAGENT,40.0,"I love Dunkin Donuts.  Growing up back east it was a staple.  When i moved to California it was a shock that the only place I could find it (back then) was at LAX.  Even that was temporary and for years there was a void....Eventually they opened stores throughout the Las Vegas area, and that helped a little.

Finally, they opened a sore in Barstow (too far), Camp Pendelton (too far the other was), Santa Monica and now Downey with more to come.

I tried the Downey store and it was nice and clean but had some issues.  First, they only had pink donuts with sprinkles.  The standard is solid pink.  OK, minor issue.  Plenty of jelly donuts.  Ordered a dozen assorted for $9.50 and an iced hazelnut coffee.  They were out!!!  How could a place known more for coffee than donuts be out of Hazelnut coffee???????

They were also out of dozen size boxes.  Not a big deal, but come on, get your act together.

Took the donuts home and they were wonderful.  We had plenty for the next day but they got stale pretty quick and were barely passable the next day.

Moral, worth a trip if you are near one as they are still as good as you may remember.  Hopefully they will have hazelnut coffee by then.  Don't buy more than you can eat the same day as the left overs will not be very good.

By the way, this location is 24 hours but not all of them are, so check ahead.More",October 2014,Dunkin'

It was quite filling so the fact that the menu photos showed more veggies than...my bowl is not very relevant but don’t be surprised at the difference. If I had been served a bowl matching the photo I would have been unable to finish it. 

My only issue was with the veggies. I like crunchy but the broccoli and carrots were difficult to chew. I wear dentures but aside from that they were under cooked and although they were hot when served it was like they were raw.

I like to put the mustard on each bite from the squirt bottles on the table.  Sometimes cheese.  So good-the bun is soft and fresh, the dog has some snap and great flavor.  Can't beat it.  Chicago dog is also great, that's really all I ever get.  My son loved the Reuben Dog, and the fries are good as well.  Nice people, they bring your food to your table.

Very enjoyable, and reasonably priced.More",November 2018,Hook Burger

Definitely worth trying!",September 2017,Hook Burger
